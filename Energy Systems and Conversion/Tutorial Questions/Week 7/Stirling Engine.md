## Background

### Thermodynamics

#### Partially constant thermodynamic processes

In order to make predictions with numerical models thermodynamic processes are idealised as partially constant:
##### Isothermal
Isothermal processes occur with no change in temperature. #definition 
##### Isochoric
Isochoric processes occur with no change in volume. #definition 

### Stirling Engines

Stirling engines are a closed system with no flow of mass across system boundaries, this makes all processes %% name of process type here %%

## Stirling engine thermal efficiency

A sterling cycle can be modelled with the following 4 stages:

1. Isochoric Heating
2. Isothermal Expansion
3. Isochoric Cooling
4. Isothermal Compression
