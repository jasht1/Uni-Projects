### Constants
Medium: Air

### Change
Compression ratio $\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}} = 8$

## Assumptions
%%[[2024-10-11]] @ 16:09%%

$s$ is constant
$$\left(\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right) = \left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{k-1}$$

As $k$ is dependant on average temperature, one can solve for a trial scenario, by estimating the average temperature and therefore a value for $k$ and then adjusting based on the answer.
