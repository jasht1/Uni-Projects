# Question 1 
[Total: 25 marks]
## a. What are the main sources of losses that prevent a wind turbine from operating at or near the Betz limit? 
[5 marks]
%%[[2025-01-08]] @ 14:51%%

The [[Betz law]] is an estimate for the theoretical maximum continuous efficiency of an open flow turbine based on the optimal proportion of energy to extract from an incompressible fluid flow. In practice turbines cannot convert all the kinetic energy extracted from the mass flow to electrical energy due to:

1. Coil losses & associated inefficiencies in the alternator,
2. Non Ideal fluid flow:
   - turbulence in the flow,
   - off axis flow,

3. Frictional losses:
	- at the fluid - turbine interface,
	- in the mechanical components,

## b. An engineer boasting about the virtues of their new wind turbine claimed it has an efficiency of 65.3%. Starting from $P= \frac{1}{2} m(v_{1}^{2}−v_{2}^{2})$, with $P$ being the power output resulting from a change in wind velocity from $v_{1}$ to $v^{2}$ across turbine’s blades, show that the engineer’s claim cannot be true and his efficiency value is in fact overestimated by at least 6 percentage points.

> [!NOTE] Assumption
> Question states $P= \frac{1}{2} m(v_{1}^{2}−v_{2}^{2})$ however this would not give $P$ but $E$ as $m$ must be given as $\dot{m}$ ($\frac{dm}{dt}$)

## c. A horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) has a blade span (diameter) of 15 m and the hub is 35 m above ground level. The wind speed at 2 m height is 5 m/s. 
### i. Calculate the actual power output of the wind turbine assuming maximum efficiency. 
[5 marks] 

### ii. A wind turbine salesman while marketing their wind turbine claimed that with the dimensions above and at 50 m height, it can produce 250 kW power at 5 m/s wind speed (this wind speed is at 2 m height from the ground). Is the claim true? 
[5 marks] 

# Question 2 
[Total: 25 marks]
## a. 
### i. Name two differences between an Otto and a Diesel Cycle. 
[2 marks] 
### iii. which is worse – putting petrol in a diesel engine or vice versa? Rationalise each scenario. 
[3 marks] 
## b. A gas turbine operating on the Brayton gas cycle has one each of isentropic compression and expansion. Air is taken into the compressor at 95 kPa and ambient temperature of 22ºC. The compressor has a ratio of 6 to 1 while the compressed air is heated to 827ºC. The combustion products then go through expansion in a turbine. 
### i. Draw an annotated schematic and the T-S diagram for this cycle matching the numbering of each stream or process 
[5 marks] 

### ii. Compute the thermal efficiency of the cycle. 
[10 marks] 

### iii. Discuss the result above with respect to the compressor work and total turbine work. Your discussion should touch on what should be maximised and what should be minimised to ensure the economic viability of gas turbines. 
[5 marks] 
[Note that interpolation from thermodynamic tables is required to obtain accurate results in this task] 

# Question 3  
## a.
### i. What is Stoichiometric air?
[2 marks]

Stoichiometric connotes an amount in proportion to it's necessity in a chemical reaction. It means nothing without context but in the context of a specific reaction in this case likely the combustion of a fuel, it would be the exact mass of air necessary to achieve complete complete combustion based on the mass of the other reactants.

### ii. What is meant by lean and rich fuel mixtures? State an advantage and a disadvantage of an engine running on either. 
[8 marks]

## b. A gaseous fuel (C8H18) is burned in the presence of air that is assumed completely dry. Volumetric analysis of the gaseous products on a dry basis revealed the following composition:

| Name            | Proportion |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Carbon dioxide  | 10%        |
| Oxygen          | 5.6%       |
| Carbon monoxide | 0.9%       |
| Nitrogen        | 83.5%      |

### i. Calculate the air–to–fuel ratio 
[5 marks]
### ii. What is the percentage of theoretical air used, and 
[5 marks]
### iii. Determine the quantity of water vapour that condenses as the products are cooled to 25°C at atmospheric pressure.

Note: you may take atmospheric pressure to be 105 Pa.
