Exergy $X$ is the inverse of entropy, it quantifies the potential for useful work of a process.

When [[Knowledge/Sciences/Physics/Thermodynamics/entropy|entropy]] $s$ is generated exergy is destroyed.

Exergy is not conserved, it can be destroyed (converted to [[Knowledge/Sciences/Physics/Thermodynamics/entropy|entropy]]), but it cannot be created (*in a closed system)*.

$$\dot X = \left(1-\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right) \dot Q$$
$$\dot X = \dot m \psi$$
where:
$\psi$ is flow given by: $$\psi = (h-h_{0}) - T_{0}(s-s_{0})+\frac{V^{2}}{2}+gz$$
where:
