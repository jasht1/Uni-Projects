## Problem solving
%%[[2024-09-26]] @ 15:56%%

 - Step 1: problem statement
 - Step 2: draw a schematic – and annotate it with known info/variables
 - Step 3: make assumptions and approximations
 - Step 4: apply physical laws
 - Step 5: determine unknown properties at known states to solve the problem from relationships or tables
 - Step 6: substitute known quantities and perform calculations
 - Step 7: reasoning, verification and discussion – check to make sure that the results are reasonable, intuitive and verify the validity of assumptions
