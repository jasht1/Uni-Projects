## Question 1
### a. Calculate the heat transferred in the evaporator and condenser (in Watts) for each of the water flow rates above 
[10 marks]
### b. Appropriately tabulate your results. 
[10 marks]

## Question 2
### a. For each flow rate in your table, determine the COP of the system. 
[10 marks]
### b. Plot the COP against the saturation or condensing temperature. 
[10 marks]
## Question 3
### a. Plot the pressure vs temperature for the evaporator and condenser at the different water flow rates. 
[10 marks]
### b. Discuss the trend and any other observations. 
[10 marks]
## Question 4
### a. Plot the evaporator and condenser heat transferred against temperature 
[10 marks]
### b. Discuss the trend and any other observations. 
[10 marks]
## Question 5
### Explain what happens if the water supplied into the unit is cooled or warmed below and above those used in tasks 1-4 above? How will the heat transferred, and COP be affected? 
[5 marks]
## Question 6
### It is proposed that water should be used as the refrigerant instead of R-134a in an air conditioner where the minimum temperature never goes below the freezing point. Would you support this proposal or not? Kindly explain. 
[5 marks]
### Pay particular attention to detail, appropriately formatting your report with a good introduction, procedure, diagrams of experimental with appropriate labelling, discussion accompanying your answers, and uncertainty analysis.
