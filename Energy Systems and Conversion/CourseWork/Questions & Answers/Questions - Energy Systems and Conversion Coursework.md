## Question 5
### Explain what happens if the water supplied into the unit is cooled or warmed below and above those used in tasks 1-4 above? How will the heat transferred, and COP be affected? 
[5 marks]
## Question 6
### It is proposed that water should be used as the refrigerant instead of R-134a in an air conditioner where the minimum temperature never goes below the freezing point. Would you support this proposal or not? Kindly explain.
