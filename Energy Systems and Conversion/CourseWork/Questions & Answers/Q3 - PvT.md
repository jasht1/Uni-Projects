#### Evaporator

There is no clear trend displayed between pressure and temperature in the evaporator. That is not to say there is no relationship but from the data collected it cannot be stated either way as only 2 flow rates where tested and these did not form distinct groupings. It may be the case that if more flow rates are tested and other variables are controlled a trend might emerge.

#### Condenser

In the condenser clear trends can be seen. The pressure and temperature display a linear correlation with a Pearson pairwise value of 0.92. The mass flow rate of the coolant has an inverse correlation with both pressure and temperature. By plotting Pressure divided by temperature against mass flow rate, it becomes clear the relationship is of an exponentially diminishing nature.
