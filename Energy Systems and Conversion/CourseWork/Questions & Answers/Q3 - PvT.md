#### Evaporator

There is no clear trend displayed, that is not to say there is no relationship but from the data collected it cannot be stated either way as only 2 flow rates where tested and these did not form distinct groupings. It may be the case that if more flow rates are tested and other variables are controlled a trend might emerge.

#### Condenser

A clear trend can be seen, mass flow rate of the coolant has an inverse correlation with both pressure and temperature.
