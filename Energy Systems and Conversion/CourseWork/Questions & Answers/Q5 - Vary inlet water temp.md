## Question 5
### Explain what happens if the water supplied into the unit is cooled or warmed below and above those used in tasks 1-4 above? How will the heat transferred, and COP be affected? 
[5 marks]

The water supplied to the unit is used as a thermal reservoir to absorb and release thermal energy predictably that is to say without changing temperature. Naturally when water absorbs / releases energy in the condenser / evaporator respectively it dose change temperature but, by the fact that it is flowing, the system reaches a steady state with a constant and predictable temperature gradient. 
In the experiment detailed in this report, the flow rate has been used as an independent variable to affect the system. 
If the water supplied to the uni
