## Question 5
### Explain what happens if the water supplied into the unit is cooled or warmed below and above those used in tasks 1-4 above? How will the heat transferred, and COP be affected? 
[5 marks]

The water supplied to the unit is used as a thermal reservoir to absorb and release thermal energy predictably, that is to say without changing temperature. Naturally when water absorbs / releases energy in the condenser / evaporator respectively it dose change temperature but, by the fact that it is flowing, the system reaches a steady state with a constant and predictable temperature gradient. This average temperature at steady state is the effective temperature of the thermal reservoir.
In the experiment detailed in this report, the flow rate has been used as an independent variable to affect the system. This works by changing the effective temperature of the thermal reservoir and thus effecting the the rate at which it absorbs and emits energy.
If the temperature of the water supplied to the unit is change it will have a similar effect, varying the effective temperature of the thermal reservoirs i.e. the heat exchange coils in the evaporator and condenser.
