### b) Discuss the trend and any other observations.

On first inspection, the trends between heat transfer rate and phase change chamber temperature are not obvious in either the evaporator or condenser as they are not particularly strong, with Pearson pairwise correlations of close to -0.5. Specifically the -0.52 and -0.49 for the evaporator and condenser respectively. This is to say the data suggests a weak negative correlation between the heat transfer rate and the temperature of the phase change chamber.

It would be intuitive to assume that the rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature gradient between the phase change chamber and the thermal reservoir, and that, increasing the flow rate will increase the temperature gradient, however the experimental data contradicts this.

Increasing the flow rate exponentially decreases the temperature change across the coil.
