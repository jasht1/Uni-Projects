The $s$ and $z$ variables and their respective domains allow engineers to analyse both linear and oscillatory system dynamics intuitively. 
$$\large s = \sigma + j\omega$$
The $s$ variable exists in a Cartesian space with it's real part $\sigma$ representing exponential growth, or decay if negative, and it's imaginary component $j\omega$ representing oscillations and their frequency. A systems natural modes can be understood by where it's poles lay in the $s$-domain.

$$\large z = r e^{j\Omega}$$
