Adding the effective brightness of pixels to one side and subtracting the brightness of those on the other will show the effective gradient along that axis like taking a local derivative. This is the principle behind the Sobel filter, where the magnitude of two axial gradient detecting kernels are summed to the effect of a rudimentary edge detection filter.

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{Horisontal Sobel Filter} &\quad&
\text{Vertical Sobel Filter} &\quad&
\text{Edge Detect} \\
G_{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
-1, & 0, & 1 \\ 
-2, & 0, & 2 \\ 
-1, & 0, & 1 \\ 
\end{bmatrix} &&
G_{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
-1, & -2, & -1 \\ 
0, & 0, & 0 \\ 
1, & 2, & 1 \\ 
\end{bmatrix} &&
E = \sqrt{G_{x}{^2} + G_{y}{^2}}
\end{array}

Applied to the black and white brain image considered in the previous section this method can clearly outline the features of the brain.

It's worth noting the impact of the size of the sobel filter, the reader will notice
