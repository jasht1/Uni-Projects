This lecture covered convolutions, below are my previous notes on convolution operations:

> ![convolution](convolution.md)

In a discrete time domain systems can be categorised into:

1. finite impulse response (FIR)
Are conditionally stable, as output doesn't use past outputs.


2. infinite impulse response (IIR)
In some cases outputs are dependant on previous outputs. This feedback can make the system unstable.
