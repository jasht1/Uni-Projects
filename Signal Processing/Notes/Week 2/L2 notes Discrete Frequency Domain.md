A digital filter frequency response is given by:
$$\LARGE H(e^{j\omega_{d}}) = \sum\limits ^{\infty} _{k=-\infty} h[k] e^{-j \omega_{d} k}$$

Where:
- $H(e^{j\omega_{d}})$ is the digital filter response as a function of 
- $h[k]$ is the value of the impulse response at sample $k$
- $e^{-j \omega_{d} k}$ accounts for 


Useful identity:
$$e^{j\theta} + e^{-j\theta} = 2 \cos \theta $$
