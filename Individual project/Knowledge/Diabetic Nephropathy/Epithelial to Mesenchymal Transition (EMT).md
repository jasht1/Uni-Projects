## Summary

> [!QUOTE] Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition #definition 
> An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process that allows a polarized epithelial cell, which normally interacts with basement membrane via its basal surface, to undergo multiple biochemical changes that enable it to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2689101/#B1)). The completion of an EMT is signaled by the degradation of underlying basement membrane and the formation of a mesenchymal cell that can migrate away from the epithelial layer in which it originated.

In Layman's terms, it is a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces (Epithelial) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells (Mesenchymal).
