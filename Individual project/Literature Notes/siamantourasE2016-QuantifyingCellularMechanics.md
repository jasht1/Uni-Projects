> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Tubulointerstitial fibrosis represents the major underlying pathology of diabetic nephropathy where loss of cell-to-cell adhesion is a critical step. To date, research has predominantly focussed on the loss of cell surface molecular binding events that include altered protein ligation. In the current study, atomic force microscopy single cell force spectroscopy (AFM-SCFS) was used to quantify changes in cellular stiffness and cell adhesion in TGF-β1 treated kidney cells of the human proximal tubule (HK2). AFM indentation of TGF-β1 treated HK2 cells showed a significant increase (42%) in the elastic modulus (stiffness) compared to control. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that increased cell stiffness is accompanied by reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The corresponding changes in stiffness, due to F-actin rearrangement, affected the work of detachment by changing the separation distance between two adherent cells. Overall, our novel data quantitatively demonstrate a correlation between cellular elasticity, adhesion and early morphologic/phenotypic changes associated with tubular injury.
From the Clinical Editor
Diabetes affects many patients worldwide. One of the long term problems is diabetic nephropathy. Here, the authors utilized atomic force microscopy single cell force spectroscopy (AFM- SCFS) to study cellular stiffness and cell adhesion after TGF1 treatment in human proximal tubule kidney cells. The findings would help further understand the overall disease mechanism in diabetic patients.

> ## Summary
> 
> This study finds that pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta $\text{TGF} \! - \! \beta 1$ affected cell morphology increasing the [[Young's modulus]] of $\text{HK}2$ cells. This was associated with a weakening of cell adhesion shown by:
> 
> - 53% decrease in the work of detachment,
> 
> - 46% decrease in the distance to complete separation,
> 
> - 19% lower peak unbinding force,
> 
> - 35% fewer TRE events.
> 
> Indicating $\text{TGF} \! - \! \beta 1$ plays a role in the early changes of tubular injury in human proximal tubule cells.

> ## Tubular Injury
> 
> Tublar injury involves:
> 
> - loss of cell integrity
> 
> - decreased expression of proteins that bind the cells together
> 
> - altered cell morphology
> 
> - reorganisation of cell cytoskeleton
> 
> - de-novo (novel gene expression) of fibroblastic markers
