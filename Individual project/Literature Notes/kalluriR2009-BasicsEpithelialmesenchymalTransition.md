# Notes

> [!note]
> ## Summary
> 
> [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)]] is a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]).
> 
> There are 3 sub-types of EMT, of which type 2 is relevant to diabetic nephropathy. Type 2 EMT's occur around inflammation-inducing injuries for tissue regeneration, however with chronic inflammation they are associated with fibrosis and cause progressive organ damage.

> > An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process that allows a polarized epithelial cell, which normally interacts with basement membrane via its basal surface, to undergo multiple biochemical changes that enable it to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2689101/#B1)). The completion of an EMT is signaled by the degradation of underlying basement membrane and the formation of a mesenchymal cell that can migrate away from the epithelial layer in which it originated.

> So far as I understand [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)]] is a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]).
> 
> Their previously [[epithelial]] phenotypes/traits are replaced by those typical of [[Mesenchymal]]. Of primary importance the basal surface degrades and they loose adhesion to their [[basement membrane]], becoming migratory.
> 
> ## Classification of EMT into three different subtypes
> 
> EMT's are distinguished based on their context and functional consequences into one of 3 types:
> 
> ![[EMT types.png]]
> 
> 1. Type 1
> 
>   **Context:** Embryo
> 
>   **Consequence:** embryogenesis - Normal development
> 
> 2. Type 2
> 
>   **Context:** inflammation
> 
>   **Consequence:** fibrosis - progressive organ damage
> 
> 3. Type 3
> 
>   **Context:** Cancer
> 
>   **Consequence:** metastasis - Invasive cancer
> 
> ## Type 2 EMT: EMT associated with tissue regeneration and organ fibrosis
> 
> In the undisturbed organ [[epithelial]] cells maintain an extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion molecules (CAM) that support the cells functionally and structurally support the functional organ surfaces.
> 
> ![[Fibrosis EMT process.png]]
> 
> Resident fibroblasts and inflammatory cells release molecules such as TGF-β, PDGF, EGF, and FGF-2 that trigger EMT's, and degrade these structures. Where the basement membrane (part of the ECM) fails cells that do not undergo EMT tend to die (apoptosis).
