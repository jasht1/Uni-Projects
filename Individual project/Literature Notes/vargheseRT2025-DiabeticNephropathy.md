> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in developed countries, including the United States. It is considered a microvascular complication and occurs in both diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). The disorder presents with persistent albuminuria and a progressive decline in the glomerular filtration rate. There is substantial evidence that early treatment can delay or prevent the progression of the disorder. Reliable tests for diagnosis and monitoring include urine albuminuria and the estimated GFR (eGFR). Optimizing glycemia and reasonable blood pressure control are pivotal in halting the progression of DKD.

# Notes

> ## Summary
> 
> #WIP
> 
> ## Etiology / Epidemiology (Who gets it?)
> 
> Diabetic nephropathy develops in 30-40% of people with diabetes both type 1 and 2. In type 1 it tends to develop after 15-20 years and it is expected to be similar in type 2 however this is harder to establish.
> 
> ## Prognosis (How bad is it?)
> 
> Diabetic nephropathy has a high morbidity and mortality rate, the majority of patients die from end stage renal disease.
> 
> ## Pathophysiology (How does it happen?)
> 
> In type 1 diabetes a lack of insulin and in type 2 Insulin resistance cause chronic hyperglycemia a condition where there is too much glucose in the blood.
> 
> Hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress which in turn causes inflammation. [^Hyperglycemia&OidativeStress] Inflammation triggers [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)]] via the increased production of cytokines and chemokines which lead to fibrosis. This reduces the elasticity and results in intraglomerular hypertension and tubular injury.

> ## How is it normally diagnosed?
> 
> diagnostic criteria include:
> 
> - Elevated blood pressure (in exess of 120/80 mmHg)
> 
> - Progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (eGFR is below 60 mL/min)
> 
> - Persistent albuminuria (greater than 300 mg/d) on at least two visits 3-6 months apart.
> 
> > [!QUOTE] Persistent albuminuria
> 
> > Diabetic nephropathy is diagnosed by persistent albuminuria on two or more occasions, separated at least by three months on early morning urine samples. Persistent albuminuria is greater than 300 mg over 24 hours or greater than 200 micrograms per minute. Moderately increased albuminuria is when the urine albumin excretion rate is between 30 to 300 mg over 24 hours and is a marker of early DN.
