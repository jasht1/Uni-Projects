> [!abstract]- Abstract
> The renal system consists of the kidney, ureters, and the urethra. The overall function of the system filters approximately 200 liters of fluid a day from renal blood flow which allows for toxins, metabolic waste products, and excess ion to be excreted while keeping essential substances in the blood. The kidney regulates plasma osmolarity by modulating the amount of water, solutes, and electrolytes in the blood. It ensures long term acid-base balance and also produces erythropoietin which stimulates the production of red blood cell. It also produces renin for blood pressure regulation and carries out the conversion of vitamin D to its active form. The renal development, the process of urine production and excretion, and the clinical significance of the renal system will be the focus of this article.

> [!YellowHighlight]
> "Glomerular filtration is the initial process in urine production. It is a passive process in which hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid and solute through a membrane with no energy requirement."

> [!GrayHighlight]
> "foot processes of podocytes of the glomerular capsule that creates more selective filtration."

> [!YellowHighlight]
> "GFR is the volume of fluid filtered in a minute, and it depends on the net filtration pressure, the total available surface area for filtration, and filtration membrane permeability."

> [!YellowHighlight]
> "The normal GFR is between 120 to 125ml/min."

> [!YellowHighlight]
> "the PCT reabsorbs all the glucose and amino acids as well as 65% of Na and water."

> [!YellowHighlight]
> "The descending limb functions to reabsorb water via osmosis."

> [!YellowHighlight]
> "in the ascending limb, Na moves passively down its concentration gradient in the thin segment of the ascending limb, and also sodium, potassium, and chlorides get reabsorbed"%% end annotations %%
