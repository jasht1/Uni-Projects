> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Surface forces determine the behaviour and properties of colloids, including biological molecules, micelles and membranes. Recently it has been realized that the atomic force microscope, which is normally used to image the topography of surfaces with high resolution, can also be used to measure surface forces. The advantages of the atomic force microscope are that virtually any surface of interest can be investigated and that measurements are relatively fast and easy to perform. Furthermore, since the interacting areas are small (typically 102–1002 nm2) samples only need to be smooth and homogeneous on a small scale. Local surface properties, like the surface charge density or micromechemical properties, can be determined.

> "the surface of the AFM probe. For microscopy the most commonly used probes are the sharp microfabricated silicon nitride or silicon tips which provide a high lateral resolution. These probes also provide high resolution when measuring surface forces, but introduce the problem that the surface geometry is difficult to determine in the 10 nm regime [18,19]. In addition, the surface chemistry of silicon nitride tips, which are most frequently used for force measurements, is rather complex [20-22]."
> > [!note]
> > Silicone nitride tips are finer, so well suited to surface imaging as the can provide higher lateral resollution. However they are poorly suited for measuring surface forces as the topology and chemistry make it difficult to calculate the force they exert accurately.

> "The problems of unknown surface geometry and chemistry can be solved by attaching smooth micrometer-sized spheres to the cantilever (Fig. 1). For a sphere of radius R and a fiat, a simple equation relates the measured force F to the interaction energy per unit area VA:  F(D)  Va(D) = 2qrR"
