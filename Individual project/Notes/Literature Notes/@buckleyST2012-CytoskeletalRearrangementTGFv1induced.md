> "Before treatment, cells exhibited a stiffness of 8.3 ± 1.1 kPa when cultured on glass. Similarly, those grown on a matrix of collagen I displayed a Young's modulus of 9.1 ± 2.9 kPa. Following treatment, cell stiffness significantly increased, with a value of 21.5 ± 5.2 kPa for those grown on glass."

> "Interestingly, increases in cell stiffness were most apparent in cells treated with TGF-β1 and cultured on a collagen I substrate. Our data indicate that collagen I significantly (P b 0.05) augments the pro-stiffening effects of TGF-β1 (Figure 5, E). Together, these results confirm that actin filament organization is a determinant factor in the modulation of cell stiffness and suggest that ECM interactions may also play a contributory role."

> > Bar graph illustrating the average cell stiffness representing N750 single force–distance curves (means ± SD). On glass, TGF-β1 stimulation resulted in an increased stiffness of more than twofold in comparison with untreated cells. Exposure to TGF-β1 of cells cultured on collagen I enhanced stiffness fourfold and significantly augmented the effect of TGF-β1 alone.%% end annotations %%

> [!note]
> ## Summary
> 
> This paper uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation to measure changes in A549 alveolar epithelial cell stiffness in response to $\text{TGF} \! - \! \beta 1$ and correlated those findings with AFM imaging and high contrast analysis (HCA). This showed the association between increased cell stiffness as measured by AFM indentation and the spindle-shaped mesenchymal phenotype as observed by imaging.
