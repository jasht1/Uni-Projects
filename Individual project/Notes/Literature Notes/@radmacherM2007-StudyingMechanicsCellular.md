> > (A) shows the three main parts of the force curve: deflection is constant before the tip makes contact (at negative sample heights), deflection is proportional to sample height (at positive sample heights), and a strong adhesion during retraction.

> > (B) shows the tip is deflected away from the sample before contact (due to electrostatic repulsion), but finally jumps into contact, due to strong van der Waals forces. These van der Waals forces cause also the large hysteresis during retract, which can be used to calculate the adhesion force (around 300 pN in this case).> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=362&annotation=ZBST469Q)
> "The Poisson ratio n can have values between 0 and 0.5. A value of 0.5 corresponds to an incompressible material, which is a reasonable assumption for a wellhydrated soft polymeric gel such as the cytoskeleton."

> "These equations assume that the sample is:

> - infinitely thick.

> Strictly speaking, none of these assumptions necessarily applies to cells."

> "The passive mechanical responses of cells are determined mainly by three cellular components:

> "For most other eukaryotic cells, the cytoskeleton, composed of various filamentous proteins—mainly actin, but also microtubules and intermediate filaments—and associated proteins, control the molecular architecture and mechanical properties."

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=363&annotation=NWEGHUGE)
> "Especially in the case of actin cytoskeleton, numerous accessory proteins are known to control the lengths of filaments, cross-link the filaments, anchor the filaments to the membrane, induce the formation of filament bundles including stress fibers, and link the filaments to cell–substrate adhesion sites"

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=363&annotation=ZH2IJM43)
> "The cytoskeleton is a polymeric, fibrous network, which will not appear homogenous at a length scale comparable to or smaller than the mesh size (a few tens of nanometers)."

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=363&annotation=QYGDRN3P)
> "the mechanical response of the cytoskeleton will not be isotropic in the presence of stress fibers or attachments to the membrane."

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=363&annotation=4ZN38QHM)
> "sample thickness will be an issue for any estimate of mechanical properties, as a cell is never infinitely thick"

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=363&annotation=7ABB9WD4)
> "As the indentation approaches the thickness of the region, no further compression is possible. Hence, the deflection becomes proportional to the sample height as on a stiV sample. EVectively, the cantilever senses only the stiVness of the underlying substrate."

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=365&annotation=GIUNX8JC)
> "relative stiffness can always be extracted from the data if a region undergoes limited changes in thickness"

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=367&annotation=3S5J7GUC)
> "At higher loading forces, the underlying cytoskeletal structures start to appear in the image."%% end annotations %%
