> > Force curve on a glass slide. The cantilever deflection (left y-axis) is plotted versus sample height. The right y-axis gives the corresponding force, using a cantilever force constant of 10 mN/m. Panel.
> > (A) shows the three main parts of the force curve: deflection is constant before the tip makes contact (at negative sample heights), deflection is proportional to sample height (at positive sample heights), and a strong adhesion during retraction.

> > (B) shows the tip is deflected away from the sample before contact (due to electrostatic repulsion), but finally jumps into contact, due to strong van der Waals forces. These van der Waals forces cause also the large hysteresis during retract, which can be used to calculate the adhesion force (around 300 pN in this case).> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2LPRUTGQ?page=362&annotation=ZBST469Q)
> "The Poisson ratio n can have values between 0 and 0.5. A value of 0.5 corresponds to an incompressible material, which is a reasonable assumption for a wellhydrated soft polymeric gel such as the cytoskeleton."

> "These equations assume that the sample is homogeneous, isotropic, and infinitely thick. Strictly speaking, none of these assumptions necessarily applies to cells."

> "The passive mechanical responses of cells are determined mainly by three cellular components: the cell membrane or cell wall, the cytoskeleton, and the cytosol."%% end annotations %%
