> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Tubulointerstitial fibrosis represents the major underlying pathology of diabetic nephropathy where loss of cell-to-cell adhesion is a critical step. To date, research has predominantly focussed on the loss of cell surface molecular binding events that include altered protein ligation. In the current study, atomic force microscopy single cell force spectroscopy (AFM-SCFS) was used to quantify changes in cellular stiffness and cell adhesion in TGF-β1 treated kidney cells of the human proximal tubule (HK2). AFM indentation of TGF-β1 treated HK2 cells showed a significant increase (42%) in the elastic modulus (stiffness) compared to control. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that increased cell stiffness is accompanied by reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The corresponding changes in stiffness, due to F-actin rearrangement, affected the work of detachment by changing the separation distance between two adherent cells. Overall, our novel data quantitatively demonstrate a correlation between cellular elasticity, adhesion and early morphologic/phenotypic changes associated with tubular injury.
From the Clinical Editor
Diabetes affects many patients worldwide. One of the long term problems is diabetic nephropathy. Here, the authors utilized atomic force microscopy single cell force spectroscopy (AFM- SCFS) to study cellular stiffness and cell adhesion after TGF1 treatment in human proximal tubule kidney cells. The findings would help further understand the overall disease mechanism in diabetic patients.

> > The effects of the cytokine TGF-β1 (48h;10ng/mL) on the E modulus of HK2  cells. The values inside the box represent the first (lower value) and third quartile, the line  within the box represents the median, the (-) show the minimum and maximum observations  and the (○) symbol the indicates outliers. (A) Fitting of Hertz model in incremental parts of  displacement helped to determine the contact point for each cell separately. The depth of  indentation was customised to 10% of the cell's height. (B) Treated cells showed an  increase of 71% compared to the untreated group. Key significances of more than 30 cells  from 3 separate experiments are shown, ***p<0.001. Cell morphology was affected by  cytoskeletal reorganisation (red), resulting in such a significant increase of E modulus.%% end annotations %%
