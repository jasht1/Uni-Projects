# First Meeting with Eleftherios Siamantouras
[[2024-10-22]] @ 11:00

## Summarising project breif

there is some AFM-single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) data, this is measuring:
- cell to cell adhesion (not feasible)
- Cell elasticity

contact mechanics of biological systems. 

Cells, being fluid covered by cytoskeleton have complex mechanical properties.

At the molecular level not all proteins return to their original shape when deformed, this is largely due to the energy dissipated by the friction of the fluid.

This can be understood with the Hertzian contact mechanics model. 

### Project 

1. Processing of force displacement curves

2. Analysis, calculation, of [[Young's modulus]]

3. Finite element analysis or Statistical analysis, 

4. JPK Signal Processing

5. SPSS or Python

### Next steps

Look at Loading and unloading Force displacement, especially elastic component of loading of the molecular structure that corresponds to force displacement indentation, F-actin cytoskeleton.
