### Marking Feedback
Highly organised meetings, timely attendance. Notes and comments from meetings were embedded in the proposal.


Project description is good and reflects previous discussions and demonstrates a good understanding of the interdisciplinary background.

A brief connective line after the opening line is suggested e.g. It has been shown that the structure of the proximal tubules of the nephron has been altered and at the single cell this is manifested as an elongated shape of cell, with effects on cytoskeleton.
  

Structure is logical, although please be aware of misleading titles e.g. page 4 ‘Project Summary’ should be Aims & Objectives.

Also, it is advised to read thoroughly important parts of reports such as Aims, to avoid mistakes such as ‘though’ should be ‘through’.

Objectives were written very well with a good level of analysis.

Project requirements section is analytical, however there are a few redundancies e.g. calibration is not needed, the dielectric attraction/repulsion is too small and can be ignored.

A Gantt chart is included. Planning is reasonable. ‘Investigation’ should be renamed to Analysis.

#### Too much stuff in annexes
Adding everything into the annex is not always advisable, It may confuse the marker or introduce uncertainty by introducing too much information without careful enough structure. 

#### Intro lines

Background could do with a slightly more gentle intro

#### The 2 most important sections in a report are

1. Abstract
2. Aims & Objectives

#### Terminology notes

Cells have **structure** not anatomy

Research -> background reading

#### Make gant more technical
