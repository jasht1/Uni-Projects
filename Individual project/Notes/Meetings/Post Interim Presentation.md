### Need to explain the indentation depth and how this is important for capturing useful data
- [ ] explain the indentation depth and how this is important for capturing useful data


### Need to associate molecular elements to their contribution to cell mechanics
- [ ] associate molecular elements to their contribution to cell mechanics


### Invoke counter argument to EMT based understanding of tubular damage in diabetic nephropathy

### Find figure of f-d curve that exemplifies the response of different levels of cell structure
- [ ] Include fd curve & explation of different layers of cell structure

### Elaborate on contact point 

- Contact point is made ambiguous by
	- Electrostatic forces
	- microvillas 
	- cell adhesion molecules

Do some trials manually changing contact point to give reasonable bounds for error.

### Thoroughly go through the Hertz equation
