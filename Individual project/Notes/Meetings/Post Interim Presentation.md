## Going over feedback
%%[[2025-03-04]] @ 11:36%%

- Need to explain the indentation depth and how this is important for capturing useful data
- Need to associate molecular elements to their contribution to cell mechanics

##

- z axis actuation is on cantilever not bed.

##

- Find figure of f-d curve that exemplifes the response of different levels of cell structure, 

## Contact point 

- Contact point is made ambiguous by
	- Electrostatic forces
	- microvillas 
	- cell adhesion molecules

Do some trials manually changing contact point to give reasonable bounds for error.

##

- Thoroughly go thorugh the Hertz equation
