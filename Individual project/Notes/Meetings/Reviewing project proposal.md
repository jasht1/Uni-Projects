In order to avoid viscoelastic drag all measurements where recorded with a velocity of less than 5 micrometers per second.

Single section for anatomy and pathophysiology.



Read: **[claire hills diabetologia 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-011-2409-9)** specifically:
- abstract
- atomic force spectroscopy
	- association between loss of structure (ie mechanics) and loss of function.

Indentor will have only moved through 10% of 

Each cell has 3 force displacement curves, and will require 3 analysis. 
Optimal indentation depth 

Do analysis in JPK software, do notation in excel


## Aims

Use mechanics to understand loss of function of the tubular part of the nephron by analysing atomic force microscopy nano indentation.

By taking a mechanical approach we avoid the prohibitively complicated biochemistry.

## Key objectives
%%[[2024-11-05]] @ 14:34%%

- Identify and Understand the relevant Hertzian contact mechanics model
- How the model applies to nano indentation force displacement curves
- Conduct brief literature review on force displacement curves on single cell experiments
- Process raw force displacement data,
	- Identify errors and correct/reject curves as appropriate
		- systematic
		- recording
	- Identify contact point
		- Identify contact with cell membrane
	- Identify Linear region
	- Identify molecular structure that correspond with features of the curve
	- Apply model
- Calculation of Young's modulus
	- Refine parameters
- Statistical analysis
	- Graphs between healthy and diseased cells
	- Which parameters are most effective for diagnosis
	- Identify Optimal indentation depth
