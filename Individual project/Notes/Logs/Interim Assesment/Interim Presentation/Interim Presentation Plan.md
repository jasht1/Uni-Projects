### Full Assessment Criteria

> [!Quote]- From the Brief
> 
> The purpose of the interim phase assessment is:
> - To evaluate the student’s technical understanding, progress and future plans.
> - To ensure that the student’s approach to project planning and project management will allow them to complete their project.
> - To uncover any problems within the project and provide feedback that will help the student resolve these issues.
> - To provide feedback from a member of academic staff other than the student’s supervisor (i.e. the second marker)
> 
> #### Marking Areas
> - ~~Evaluation of the written report (20%)~~
> - Evaluation of oral examination (20%)
> - Technical progress against the work programme (20%)
> - Future plans (20%)
> - Effective project management (20%)
> - Log book (deduct 10% if not seen)
> - ~~Risk Assessment (if applicable; deduct 10% if not seen)~~
> - ~~Updated ethics application (if applicable; deduct 10% if not seen)~~
> 
> #### The Oral Examination
> The student will be required to provide a **20-minute** oral examination. Both the student’s supervisor and the second marker will be present in the examination, and both will assess the student’s performance. The second marker will have read the student’s project objectives form, but in most cases they will not have had any involvement in the student’s project. This will challenge the student to **communicate technical information in a clear and unambiguous way to a third party**.
> 
> The oral examination will take the form of a round table meeting. The student is encouraged to **prepare a set of handouts** that they will use in the oral examination. These may could include bullet point lists, Gantt charts, graphs, photographs etc. The student must also **bring their logbook** to the meeting, and they will be allowed to refer to its contents during the presentation.
> 
> During the presentation, the student will be asked to **describe** their **project**. They will be expected to **discuss** their **progress** and **outline** the student’s **future plans** and respond to questions from the supervising team.
> 
> #### Learning Outcomes
> 
> **LO2**: Integrate the knowledge acquired during their degree studies to propose creative, innovative and inclusive solutions to an unfamiliar problem.
> 
> **LO4**: Systematically investigate and fully describe an engineering problem using the appropriate engineering, analytical or computer tools. Depending on the subject being studied, students will develop specific laboratory or manufacturing skills, or they will learn how to use computer software for analysis and design.
> 
> **LO5**: Produce full documentation of the design process and demonstrate compliance with technical, commercial, quality and customer constraints and best practice in terms of health and safety. Students should also employ sustainable engineering techniques and give due regard to environmental issues in formulating a design.
> 
> **LO7**: Liaise with professionals in various fields, and communicate effectively via written reports and oral presentations using a range of ICT.
> 
> **LO8**: Manage their time and resources in order to execute and complete a project to a satisfactory standard.
