## Introduction

This project investigates the use of atomic force microscopy AFM as a method of detecting the progression of diabetic nephropathy.  

## Diabetic Nephropathy

Diabetic nephropathy is a common and serious complication of both type 1 and 2 diabetes resulting in kidney failure due to progressive damage to the nephrons, functional units responsible for filtering the blood.

Diabetic nephropathy develops in 30-40% of people with diabetes after 15-20 years, as the disease progresses the damage accumulates and mortality rate rises. [^StatPearls]

%% connecting line from mortality to pathophysiology %%
In type 1 diabetes a lack of insulin and in type 2 Insulin resistance cause chronic hyperglycemia a condition where there is too much glucose in the blood. Hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress %% describe oxidative stress and why that causes inflammation %% which in turn causes inflammation%% describe inflammation %%. [^Hyperglycemia&OidativeStress] 
Inflammation increases production of cytokines and chemokines which trigger Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]). %% Describe how type 2 EMT cause fibrosis. %% This reduces the elasticity and results in intraglomerular hypertension and tubular injury. %% See if I can avoid using "intraglomerular hypertension" by just describing it %%
