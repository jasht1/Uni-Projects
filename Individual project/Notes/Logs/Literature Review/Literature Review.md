## Introduction

This project investigates the use of atomic force microscopy AFM as a method of detecting the progression of diabetic nephropathy.  

Diabetic nephropathy is a common and serious complication of both type 1 and 2 diabetes resulting in kidney failure due to progressive damage to the nephrons, functional units responsible for filtering the blood. %% source %%

Diabetic nephropathy develops in 30-40% of people with diabetes after 15-20 years, as the disease progresses the damage accumulates and mortality rate rises [^StatPearls].

## Diabetic Nephropathy

%% connecting line from mortality to pathophysiology %%
In type 1 diabetes a lack of insulin and in type 2 Insulin resistance cause chronic hyperglycemia a condition where there is too much glucose in the blood. Hyperglycemia causes an increased build up of reactive oxygen species (ROS) this oxidative stress causes inflammation [^Hyperglycemia&OidativeStress].
Inflammation increases production of cytokines, including TGF-$\beta1$, which trigger Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) [^OxidativeStress]. EMT is a process where cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]) [^EMT]. In this case tubular epithelial, cells which make up the fine vessels of the kidney that filter blood, loose characteristics of their extra cellular matrix (ECM) like E-cadherin, which bond them to their neighbours, and transform into myofibroblasts or undergo apoptosis (cell death) [^TubularToMyofibroblasts]. This is the process of fibrosis, which reduces the elasticity [^TGFBinducesEMT] and results in intraglomerular hypertension and tubular injury. %% See if I can avoid using "intraglomerular hypertension" by just describing it %%
