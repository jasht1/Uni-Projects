## Background

[[Diabetic nephropathy]]

[[tublar]]

Tublar injury involves:
- loss of cell integrity
- decreased expression of proteins that bind the cells together
- altered cell morphology
- reorganisation of cell cytoskeleton 
- de-novo (novel gene expression) of fibroblastic markers

### Elasticity
> Elasticity is defined as the ability of a cell to resist an applied force or stress and return to its original configuration when the stress is removed.

### SCFS
AFM-single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) measures cell adhesion.

### fibrosis
a condition where collagenous scar tissue builds up and stiffens, impairing organ function.

### 
pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-Î²1



## Data Anaylis
JPK Data analysis software was used. To signify statistical differences data were evaluated using a paired t-test. Data are expressed as mean in the text and as median and interquartile range at the graphs. Number of experiments are represented with 'n'. P b 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance

## Force vs Displacement graph analysis

### Tethering rupture events (TREs)
Tethering rupture events (TREs) are surface bond failures these happen regularly as the cytoskeleton is deformed. 
#### 'j' vs 't' TREs
TREs where sharp steps of force that are preceded by a ramp in force are classified as 'j' events whereas those preceded by a displacement plateau are 't' events.
