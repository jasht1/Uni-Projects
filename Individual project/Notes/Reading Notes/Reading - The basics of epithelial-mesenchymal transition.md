## Summary



## What is epithelial-mesenchymal transition?

I found the following summary helpful:

> [!QUOTE] Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition #definition 
> An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process that allows a polarized epithelial cell, which normally interacts with basement membrane via its basal surface, to undergo multiple biochemical changes that enable it to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2689101/#B1)). The completion of an EMT is signaled by the degradation of underlying basement membrane and the formation of a mesenchymal cell that can migrate away from the epithelial layer in which it originated.

And have based my [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)#Summary]] off it.

So far as I understand [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)]] is a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[Epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]). 
Their previously [[Epithelial]] phenotypes/traits are replaced by those typical of [[Mesenchymal]]. Of primary importance the basal surface degrades and they loose adhesion to their [[basement membrane]], becoming migratory. 

## Classification of EMT into three different subtypes

1. Type 1
2. Type 2
3. Type 3
