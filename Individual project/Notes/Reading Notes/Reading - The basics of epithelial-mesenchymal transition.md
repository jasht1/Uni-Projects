## Summary

[[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)]] is a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]). 
There are 3 sub-types of EMT, of which type 2 is relevant to diabetic nephropathy. Type 2 EMT's occur around inflammation-inducing injuries for tissue regeneration, however with chronic inflammation they are associated with fibrosis and cause progressive organ damage.

## What is epithelial-mesenchymal transition?

I found the following summary helpful:

> [!QUOTE] Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition #definition 
> An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process that allows a polarized epithelial cell, which normally interacts with basement membrane via its basal surface, to undergo multiple biochemical changes that enable it to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2689101/#B1)). The completion of an EMT is signaled by the degradation of underlying basement membrane and the formation of a mesenchymal cell that can migrate away from the epithelial layer in which it originated.

And have based my [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)#Summary]] off it.

So far as I understand [[Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)]] is a process by which cells which make up structural and functional surfaces ([[epithelial]]) transition into non-structural repair/maintenance cells ([[Mesenchymal]]). 
Their previously [[epithelial]] phenotypes/traits are replaced by those typical of [[Mesenchymal]]. Of primary importance the basal surface degrades and they loose adhesion to their [[basement membrane]], becoming migratory. 

## Classification of EMT into three different subtypes

EMT's are distinguished based on their context and functional consequences into one of 3 types:

![[EMT types.png]]

1. Type 1
   **Context:** Embryo 
   **Consequence:** embryogenesis - Normal development
2. Type 2
   **Context:** inflammation
   **Consequence:** fibrosis - progressive organ damage
3. Type 3
   **Context:** Cancer
   **Consequence:** metastasis - Invasive cancer 

## Type 2 EMT: EMT associated with tissue regeneration and organ fibrosis

In the undisturbed organ [[epithelial]] cells maintain an extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion molecules (CAM) that support the cells functionally and structurally support the functional organ surfaces.

Resident fibroblasts and inflammatory cells release molecules such as TGF-β, PDGF, EGF, and FGF-2 that trigger EMT's, and degrade these structures. Where the basement membrane (part of the ECM) fails cells that do not undergo EMT tend to die (apoptosis).
