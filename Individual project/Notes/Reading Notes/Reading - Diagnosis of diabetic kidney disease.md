## Effectiveness of histopathology

> "If renal biopsies were feasible in all patients without safety considerations, many patients would probably be diagnosed with early stages of diabetic nephropathy. Morphological changes such as mesangial expansion and thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes, as well as typical glomerulosclerosis with nodular mesangial lesions (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions), can be attributed to the impact of hyperglycemia and hyperfiltration. These changes may be observed after only a few years of disease, but their presence is variable, and patients with long-standing diabetes may display only minor changes. Because renal biopsy is not without risk of complications, the procedure is rarely used in routine clinical practice in uncomplicated cases, and is often reserved for cases with severe albuminuria, a fast decline in GFR, or where differential diagnoses are required."
