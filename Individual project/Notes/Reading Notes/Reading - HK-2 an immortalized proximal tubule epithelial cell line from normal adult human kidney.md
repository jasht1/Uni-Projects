## Summary

This publication outlines the creation of a standardised well-differentiated adult human proximal tubule epithelial cell line $\text{HK2}$. This was achieved via transduction with human pavlova virus HPV 16 E6/E7 proteins which eliminate negative regulators of cell proliferation immortalising them while maintaining the specialised phenotype.
