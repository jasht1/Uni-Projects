## Summary

This paper uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation to measure changes in A549 alveolar epithelial cell stiffness in response to $\text{TGF} \! - \! \beta 1$ and correlated those findings with AFM imaging and high contrast analysis (HCA). This showed the association between increased cell stiffness as measured by AFM indentation and the spindle-shaped mesenchymal phenotype as observed by imaging.

Recent studies suggest that cellular mechanical properties may serve as novel biological markers of cell phenotypes, reflecting changes in differentiation or cellular transformation.[24](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS1549963411002747%3Fvia%3Dihub#bb0120), [25](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS1549963411002747%3Fvia%3Dihub#bb0125) In this regard, AFM has emerged as a powerful technique capable of providing valuable insights into the nanomechanical properties of cells. Using AFM indentation we quantitatively assessed cellular elasticity in response to TGF-β1.

It is important to note that use of both AFM and HCA permitted kinetic monitoring in vitro of live cells in real time and fixed cells and in that way facilitated the measurement of novel and distinct events associated with EMT of alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, this complementary approach showed great precision, accuracy and reproducibility, allowing measurements to be made directly at the individual cell level, thus minimizing artifact and ensuring that they are reflective of cell effects.
