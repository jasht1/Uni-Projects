## Kidney Diseases and Oxidative Stress

> [!QUOTE] 4.6. Kidney Diseases and Oxidative Stress
> The kidneys are negatively affected by oxidative stress mainly because of the fact that ROS production induces the recruitment of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokine production, leading to an initial inflammatory stage.
> *...*
> So, when the oxidative stress stimuli act chronically on kidney tissues, the results will be an initial stage of inflammation and later the formation of abundant fibrotic tissue that impairs organ function potentially leading to renal failure.
