## Assessment

> [!quote] Expected progress
> Typically by the interim assessment literature reviews are broadly completed and some initial practical work (e.g. in a lab; data collection etc.) may have commenced.  

The interim comprises a **progress report** which capture the **literature survey** and future directions that the student intends to take the project based on this survey. The report is supported by a 20 minute oral examination where you must bring your **logbook** and a **Self-Evaluation Form** to demonstrate reflective practice. The Interim stage is ‘Double Marked’ (i.e. independently assessed by 1st and 2nd Marker).

The following must be submitted electronically on TurnitIn as a single document:  
- Written Report.  
- The Self Evaluation form (appended below).  
- A Risk Assessment Form (If applicable - this must be completed as soon as it is  

needed, and no later than this deadline and handed to the Supervisor. A copy should be kept in the student’s logbook.)  
- An updated ethics application should be submitted if applicable and not already done.
