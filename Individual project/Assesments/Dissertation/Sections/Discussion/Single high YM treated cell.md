It should be noted that with the small sample size of the treated group n=4, these metrics are significantly brought upward by the results of a single cell. However, other than the substantially higher Young's Module values there is no reason to expect this cell or it's experiments to be erroneous. The Hetz fit's appear representative of the observed cell response with residuals similar to average across all fits 2e-11 N.
