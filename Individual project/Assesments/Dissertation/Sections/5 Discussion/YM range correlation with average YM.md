In both the Control and the Treated group the majority of cells consistently exhibit YM lower than the group average with a few very high YM cells with higher inter experiment range. However, the range in YM increases linearly with with higher average YM values, however when range is considered as a proportion of average YM there is no correlation. %% This is likely due to  %%
