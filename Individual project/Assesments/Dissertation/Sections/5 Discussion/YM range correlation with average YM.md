In both the Control and the Treated group the majority of cells consistently exhibit YM lower than the group average with a few very high YM cells with higher inter experiment range. The range in YM increases linearly with with higher average YM values, however when range is considered as a proportion of average YM there is no correlation. This is unlikely to be a product of fitting error or the dimensionality of YM emphasising experimental inaccuracy based on how well the fittings match the observed cell responses, the cells are exhibiting a fixed linear elasticity within a given test but a range of different elasticises across tests and that range increases proportionally with the average. Neither is this a case of the higher average being a result of cells displaying higher variance in elasticity from a fixed minimum as the lower bound of even the $1000\times$ bootstrapped confidence intervals rise in tandem with the average YM.
