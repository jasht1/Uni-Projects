%% Best and worst cases based on confidence intervals %%

The sample sizes used in this report are not sufficient to produce a classifier suitable for use in industry or for diagnosis, considering the the confidence intervals of the groups established it is possible that a larger experimental dataset my prove this method to be significantly more or less effective than has been estimated here. By considering the limit cases of the 95% confidence intervals of the most distinct best case i.e. furthest means and smallest standard deviations this method may prove highly accurate requiring very few samples in contrast the worst case least distinct i.e. closest means and wisest spread would render this method completely ineffective.
