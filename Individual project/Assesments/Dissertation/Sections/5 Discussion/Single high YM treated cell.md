It should be noted that with the small sample size of the treated group $n=4$, these metrics are significantly brought upward by the results of a single cell and removing it significantly diminishes the statistical significance of the stiffening effect relied upon in this method. However, other than the substantially higher Young's Module values there is no reason to expect this cell or it's experiments to be erroneous. The Hertz fit's appear representative of the observed cell response with residuals similar to average across all fits $2 \ \text{pN}$. The relevant metrics for the cell in question are below and the reader is encouraged to judge for their own satisfaction whether the conclusions drawn from the full dataset are sufficiently supported or if the influence of this single observation undermines the findings.
