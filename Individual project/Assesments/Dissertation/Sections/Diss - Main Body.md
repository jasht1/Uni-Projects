abstract: This project investigates changes in mechanical properties of kidney cells when exposed to TGF-Î²1, which is known to induce renal disease [@gentleME2013-EpithelialCellTGFv]. The aim of this project is to provide insight on the progression of diabetic nephropathy from a mechanical perspective based on changes in mechanical properties observed in single cells using atomic force microscopy.
