 The methodology demonstrated appears to show potential for the use of single cell young's module as a biomarker and that a robust numerical method for determining the probability of late stage renal disease is achievable with relatively few samples.  Applying the methodology described on larger datasets would allow for a more robust estimate of the effect and allow for more extensive testing and validation.
