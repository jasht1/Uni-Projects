The treated cells are on average twice as stiff as the untreated cells with 500 Pa higher average young's modulus. The treated group shows a significantly higher variance with a standard deviation of 500 Pa. It should be noted that these two metrics are significantly brought upward by the results of a single cell, However, other than the substantially higher Young's Module values there is no reason to expect this cell or it's experiments to be erroneous. The Hetzian fit's appear representative of the observed cell response with residuals similar to average across all fits 2e-11 N. 

###### Table: Young's Modulus (Pa) by test group

| Group   | Mode    | Min     | Max     | Median  | Mean   | StDev  |

| Control | 160.643 | 137.977 | 1161.76 | 385.253 | 482.63 | 301.24 |
| Treated | 605.979 | 381.52  | 1964.58 | 833.028 | 983.46 | 506.70 |
