### Diabetic Nephropathy (DN)

%% #### Summary %%
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and serious complication of diabetes resulting in kidney failure due to progressive damage to the nephrons, the functional units of the kidney responsible for filtering the blood.

%% #### Epidemiology & Prognosis %%
Diabetic nephropathy develops in 30-40% of people with diabetes after 15-20 years, as the disease progresses the damage accumulates and mortality rate rises [@vargheseRT2025-DiabeticNephropathy]. Based on the risk factor of the patient treatments range from lifestyle changes and medications, to renal replacement which involves dialysis or transplantation [@vargheseRT2025-DiabeticNephropathy].

%% #### Relevant Pathophysiology %%
In type 1 diabetes a lack of insulin and in type 2 Insulin resistance cause chronic hyperglycemia a condition where there is too much glucose in the blood. Hyperglycemia causes an increased build up of reactive oxygen species (ROS) this ongoing oxidative stress causes chronic inflammation [@gonzalezP2023-HyperglycemiaOxidativeStress].

Inflammation increases production of cytokines, including TGF-$\beta 1$, which trigger Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) [@hillsCE2012-TGFvModulatesCelltocell; @pizzinoG2017-OxidativeStress]. EMT is a process where cells which make up structural and functional surfaces (epithelial) transition into repair/maintenance cells (mesenchymal) [@kalluriR2009-BasicsEpithelialmesenchymalTransition]. In this case tubular epithelial, cells which make up the fine vessels of the kidney that filter blood, transform into myofibroblasts, repair and maintenance cells %% or undergo apoptosis (cell death) %% [@iwanoM2002-EvidenceThatFibroblasts]. This is the underlying mechanism of fibrosis, which induces atrophy and scarring in the tubules %% and results in intraglomerular hypertension %% causing progressive kidney damage [@metcalfeW2007-HowDoesEarlyChronicKidneyDiseaseProgress].
