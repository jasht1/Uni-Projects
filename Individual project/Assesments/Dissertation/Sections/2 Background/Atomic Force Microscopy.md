%% #### What is AFM? %%

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a technique for characterising nanomechanical properties and structure. It is well suited to microbiology as it allows for the study of live cells [@kilpatrickJI2015-NanomechanicsCellsBiomaterials]. 

Atomic force microscopes use the deflection of a very fine probe on a flexible cantilever to detect contact forces ranging form nano to micro Newtons. There are a myriad of applications and operating modes of AFM [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy] but this report is primarily concerned with nano indentation. This involves advancing a fine tipped probe on the end of the cantilever into a sample cell producing a force over indentation depth curve, from which the elasticity of the cell can be calculated using a Hertz contact model [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy; @buttHJ1995-MeasuringSurfaceForces].

%% #### functional/mechanical description %%

The typically atomic force microscope utilise a laser focused on the free end of the cantilever such that any deflection of the probe produces an amplified deflection of the reflected beam, this is recorded by a position sensitive photodiode [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy; @buttHJ1995-MeasuringSurfaceForces].

The sample once mounted to the sample stage can be manoeuvred precisely in relative to the probe by applying voltage to piezoelectric actuators [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy; @buttHJ1995-MeasuringSurfaceForces; @giraudF2019-PiezoelectricActuatorsIntroduction] this is how the sample is advanced into the tip. Once calibrated the voltage at the actuators gives the sample stage position and the voltage at the photodiode gives the deflection of the probe, with this a force displacement curve can be produced by accounting for the stiffness of the cantilever and the relative displacement [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy; @buttHJ1995-MeasuringSurfaceForces; @kilpatrickJI2015-NanomechanicsCellsBiomaterials].

%% #### typical force displacement curve %%

A typical force displacement curve from a nano indention experiment has the following shape seen in figure %% #WIP %% (A) below. A broadly level region where the probe is not in contact with the cell; the contact region; a sloped region where the probe is indenting the cell; the turnaround point; from which the same is repeated in reverse differing mainly at the point of separation [@kilpatrickJI2015-NanomechanicsCellsBiomaterials].

%% Contact point jump %%

The exact point of contact is often ambiguous and rarely the same as the the point of separation. On approach the cantilever will be deflected away from the cell by van der waals forces until the spring force of the cantilever overcomes and surface tension takes hold [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy; @buttHJ1995-MeasuringSurfaceForces; @kilpatrickJI2015-NanomechanicsCellsBiomaterials]. 
The point of separation is typically clearer as it's associated with a "jump" in cantilever deflection as the surface tension / adhesion of the cell to the probe is overcome [@dufreneYF2002-AtomicForceMicroscopy; @buttHJ1995-MeasuringSurfaceForces; @kilpatrickJI2015-NanomechanicsCellsBiomaterials].
