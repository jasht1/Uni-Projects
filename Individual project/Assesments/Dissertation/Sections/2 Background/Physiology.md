%% #### Kidney %%

The human body can be understood as a complex biological machine, made up of many sub-mechanisms familiar to engineers. In this sense the filtration system of the human body is referred to as the renal system, in which the kidneys are a component about the size of a clenched fist that can be likened to a sophisticated water treatment plant combined with a feedback-controlled chemical processing unit. Each contain roughly a million multi step filter loops called nephrons [@bertramJF2011-HumanNephronNumber].

%% #### Nephrons %%

The nephrons are selective, able to remove waste products while keeping desirable substances in the blood. They are able to regulating essential substances such as water, electrolytes, and pH levels to strict set points. [@ogobuiroI2025-PhysiologyRenal]

%% #### glomerulus %%

The the first step unfiltered blood enters the glomerulus and if forced through several membrane filters by hydro-static pressure. The first layer permits all solutes blocking only cells. The next is negatively charged thus blocking proteins like albumin. The final layer modulates the flow resistance to vary the hydro-static pressure gradient, this will be counter balanced by the osmotic pressure such that it can be used to effectively vary the ultra filtration coefficient. [@pavenstadtH2000-RolesPodocyteGlomerular; @ogobuiroI2025-PhysiologyRenal] Leaving the glomerulus is a blood vessel containing only cells and proteins and a fractional remainder of the other solute, and the tubule carrying all the removed solute [@lumen-NephronStructure].

%% #### Tubule %%

The glomerulus is an overly aggressive filter; much of the water and solute must be re introduced to the blood from the tubules. %%in several stages. The first stage, the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) pumps all the glucose and amino acids as well as most of the sodium and water back into the blood [@ogobuiroI2025-PhysiologyRenal]. In the next more water is reabsorbed, and in the final the remainder of the sodium as well as potassium and chlorides get reabsorbed via osmosis [@ogobuiroI2025-PhysiologyRenal]. %% The tubules run along side blood vessels and using a combination of osmosis, active transport and controlled ionic gradients %%sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chlorides%% the valuable ions and most of the water is reabsorbed over several uniquely specialised segments [@ogobuiroI2025-PhysiologyRenal].  

%% #### Tubule cell %%

The structure of the tubule varies significantly across it's length to as different sections are specialised to permeate different resources, the lumen diameter and epithelial cell height values are averages of random samples [@morozovD2021-MappingKidneyTubule]. 

%% Breakdown of the layers and cell types #WIP  %%

Epithelial tubule cells are the essential building blocks of tubules. They are anchored to each other and to the extra cellular matrix (ECM) by junctions tied to their cytoskeleton [@yuASL2013-Chapter12Intercellular; @zihniC2016-TightJunctions]. In this way the cytoskeleton plays an essential role in maintaining the structure of both the individual cells and the larger structure.
