The experimental procedure used to produce the data used in this report is detailed thoroughly in reference [@siamantourasE2016-QuantifyingCellularMechanics]. Cells of the adult human proximal tubule kidney (HK2) cell line [@ryanMJ1994-HK-2] where purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Gaithersburg,  MD 20878 USA). These where maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine ($2 \ \text{mM}$), and EGF ($5 \ \text{ng/ml}$) for 48 hours. The cells where divided into 2 test groups, the "control" group and the "treated" group which where where serum starved overnight before being exposed to TBF-$\beta$, an E-cadherin antibody obtained from R&D systems, at ($10 \ \text{ng/mL}$) for a further 48 hours. 

The indentation experiments where carried out using a JPK Instruments CellHesion©200 module with a BioCell™ temperature controller to maintain a bed temperature of $37 \degree \text{C}$ on a TMC 63-530 anti-vibration table. Probes where constructed by attaching $11\ \micro \text{m}$ Polyscience PolyBeads® to Nanoworld TL-1 tipless cantilevers with a force constant of $0.03 \text{N/m}$. Each cell was indented 5 times directly above the nucleus at a constant speed of $5\ \micro \text{m / s}$ with intervals of 60 seconds. For each set of experiments the spring constant of the cantilever was calibrated using the thermal noise method and the cell's height was measured to determine an appropriate indentation depth to minimise the influence of the hard basal substrate.
