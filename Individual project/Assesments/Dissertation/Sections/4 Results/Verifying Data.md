The difference between the Hertz elasticity model for a parabolic indentation and the Hertz/Sneddon spherical indentation where minor producing effectively indistinguishable estimates for YM however the Hertz parabolic model resulted in a slightly but consistently higher residual fit error with it's slightly more progressive curvature.  Below are representative examples of each fit for the same force indentation curve.

There where some trends observed in the general shape of the residual error, specifically; 1) an initial hump at the contact point likely unaccounted for electrostatic non contact forces due to Van der Waals effect,  2) a middle dip and final flick where fit's are shallower than the actual force indention behaviour implying an under estimation of YM or a non linear elasticity. Both of these effects are particularly pronounced in the following fitting for this dataset this would be considered a bad fit.

There was a slight negative trend observed across successive tests indicative of cell relaxation with the first test indicating a 10% higher YM on average, however this was not deemed necessary to control for. The majority of cells showed strong agreement across tests resulting in tight confidence intervals and representative apparent YM values. The examples below are typical samples from each group.

There where cells that displayed significantly higher variation between experiments from both groups, this was not constantly associated with the order of the tests but did correlate with higher overall YM and only a sporadic effect. Given the shallow depth of the indention this is unlikely to be the influence of stiffer organelles but could perhaps be due to the probing site interacting with cytoskeletal structures such as the microvilli force sensing/transducing elements or structural anchor points, however It would require more advanced imaging techniques to explain these variations with confidence. Notably cells in the treated group tended to have one test with a significantly lower apparent elasticity but strong agreement in the other 4 as is the case below, this neither was consistently associated with test order.
