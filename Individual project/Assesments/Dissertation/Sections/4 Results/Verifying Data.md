The difference between the Hertz elasticity model for a parabolic indentation and the Hertz/Sneddon spherical indentation where minor producing effectively indistinguishable estimates for YM however the Hertz parabolic model resulted in a slightly but consistently higher residual fit error with it's slightly more progressive curvature.  Below are representative examples of each fit for the same force indentation curve.

There where some trends observed in the general shape of the residual error, specifically; 1) an initial hump at the contact point likely due to unaccounted for electrostatic non contact forces due to the van der walls effect,  2) a middle dip and final flick where fit's are shallower than the actual force indention behaviour implying an under estimation of YM or a non linear elasticity. Both of these effects are particularly pronounced in the following fitting for this dataset this would be considered a bad fit.

%% Checking for cell relaxation or systematic error based on observed trends in successive experimentation %%

There where no general trends observed across successive tests meaning there was no need to control for cell relaxation. The majority of cells showed strong agreement across tests resulting in tight confidence intervals and representative apparent YM values. The examples below are emblematic of typical samples from each group.

There where cells that displayed significantly higher variation between experiments from both groups however this was not constantly associated with the order of the tests. Given the shallow depth of the indention this is not likely the influence of stiffer organelles but could perhaps be due to the probing site interacting with cytoskelital structures such as the microvilli force sensing/transducing elements or structural anchor points, however It would require more advanced imaging techniques to explain these variations with confidence. Notably cells in the treated group tended to have one test with a significantly lower apparent elasticity but strong agreement in the other 4 as is the case below.
