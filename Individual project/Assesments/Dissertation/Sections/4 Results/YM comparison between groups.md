The treated cells where found to be on average twice as stiff as the untreated cells with a $517 \ \text{Pa}$ higher average young's modulus. Both groups where fairly broad with standard deviations of $306$ and $541 \ \text{Pa}$ for control and treated respectively, while this gives the treated group a $77\%$ higher variance, as a proportion of average YM they are similar being $55\%$ and $67\%$ of their respective means. Considering range as a proportion of of median
