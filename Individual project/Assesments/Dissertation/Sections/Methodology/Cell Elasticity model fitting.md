Experimental data was received in the form of `.jpk-force` logs of head height position against vertical deflection force along with experimental metadata. The JPK data processing software was used to calculate the probe height based on spring constant. At this point the curves where exported in text form. In order to establish trustworthy values for YM the function included in the JPK data processing software was used.
