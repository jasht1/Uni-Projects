Cellular changes result in change in elasticity

This project investigates the predictive power of renal tubular epithelial cell stiffness as a biomarker for the progression of Diabetic Nephropathy (DN). 
DN is a common and serious complication of diabetes resulting in kidney failure due to progressive damage to the nephrons, the functional units of the kidney responsible for filtering the blood [@metcalfeW2007-HowDoesEarlyChronicKidneyDiseaseProgress].
This loss of function is due to physical changes at the cellular level induced by cytokine TGF-$\beta$ 1 associated with an observable stiffening of the cytoskeleton [@hillsCE2012-TGFvModulatesCelltocell]. 

%% ### AFM
How dose it work
%%

A force against indentation curve of a cells can be observed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) where the deflection of a very fine probe on a flexible cantilever is measured to detect contact forces. 
From the spring constant of the cantilever the indentation and force exerted can be determined as the assembly is advanced into the sample. 
This curve can then be fitted against an elastic deformation model to determine an apparent Young's Modulus (YM).
