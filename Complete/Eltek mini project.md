# Brief
## Main questions
-  The potato slices must be separated from the water flume so how is this to be achieved?​
    
-   The product is freshy sliced. Does this cause a problem? If so, whereabouts in this process stage? What would be an acceptable solution?​
    
-   If allowed, any excess water on the product when entering the Fryer will lower efficiency and waste energy.  How is this best addressed?​
    
-   To match line throughput, how is the product rate to be adjusted through this process stage?​
	To what degree can the proposed solutions be varied in rate.
    
-   Can potential wastage be reduced, for example energy and water? If so, how?

### First stage
-   How best should the slices transported through this stage - at a production rate that can be varied - whilst at the same time flume water be allowed to drain and returned?  ​
    
-   Water from the flume collects into a tank and needs to be returned back to beneath the slices to carry product once more into this stage forming a “loop”.  What devices are needed to achieve this?   ​
    
-   Eventually the water level in the tank will reduce requiring it to be topped up to maintain a constant level.  Doing so allows the flume to continue to function.  What devices will be needed to satisfy this?​
    
-   Freshly sliced potatoes release starch into the water collected into the tank, which, over time will cause problems with excess foaming.  What could be done as part of this process to resolve the problem of foaming? ​
### Second stage
-   Slices from the previous stage need to be transported - at a production rate that can be varied - onwards into the fryer.  How is this best achieved?​
    
-   During this stage what method can be employed to remove excess water from both above and below the slices prior to entering the Fryer? What devices are required to satisfy this.  (It is this process which improves efficiency of the fryer. Less water, less energy is wasted as steam.)

what needs to be done
- professional looking design proposal sketch - Joe
	review progress [[2023-03-23]]
- write some brief answers to the questions proposed - Paul
	review progress [[2023-03-23]]
	- specifically answers to:
		- The potato slices must be separated from the water flume so how is this to be achieved?​
		- The product is freshy sliced. Does this cause a problem? If so, whereabouts in this process stage? What would be an acceptable solution?​
- research how pressure and temperature affects potato drying - Josh

## Call with [[Abdul]]
2023-03-23 @ 13:00 
[[Abdul]] has done some calculations to approximate the amount of steam produced.
## brief talk with Josh
2023-03-23 @ 04:15 
Josh has written some notes on the process and found a useful study




# Resolution
## Final presentation
2023-03-29 @ 21:47 
The presentation went well and its was followed by a rather long and rambling but overall enlightening presentation on system design / integration in industry.
