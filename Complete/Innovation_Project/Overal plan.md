## Gate 0.5

### feedback
The need to fully understand the question you have set yourself now seems to be understood by most groups, as it becomes clear that once you have this Sor in detail finding suitable solutions becomes much easier. One groups analogy is the need to look at the picture on the top of the box, BEFORE opening the jigsaw puzzle. I have used the comment that I cannot just teaching you the skills needed in your careers is like attempting to teach students to ride a bicycle in a lecture. These skills need practicing, hence the multiple gates and the opportunities for Gates #.X. Like teaching my children to ride a bicycle, the training wheels came off at Gate 3, and I must release my hold on the saddle at Gate 4 for you to fully develop your own journey. With this in mind there is not enough hours in the week for me to continue with multiple Gates 4.x ,x+1,x+2 etc. For the above reasons Gate 4.5 is my last review with groups before you cycle off to your futures.
It is clear, to me,  that this Group have moved forward and it is critical that this momentum is maintained
## Gate 1
**understood not taught normally, requirements of self research**
our focus
- Select building
- define working procedures & tools
### Feedback
| Report | to IET format  good use of  appendices, has graph of 3 years of elec & gas |
| ---- | ---- |
| Presentation | flows well, comfortable presentation, enthusiastic. Concentrate on presenting the work done and future + facts found; use bullet point to link word to the slides |
| Plan | Gantt chart show to Gate 5, include milestone Gates list responsibilities. Put full plan as appendix.= ;using new software  ok |
| Progress | very good progress now consider the graphical data on energy use; considering services, waste??? |
| Skills Matrix | good , consider what the project needs = training matrix => plan.  Look to build skill in whole group personal project next year |
| research | only 3 references; use google scholar / Library databases  Estate can provide some data but NOT meetings |
| Direction | consider use of mind map; good method in choice of building |
| Communication | 4 meetings in 4 weeks but list of notes in appendix ; |
| SoR | needs to fit the full set of services ; given example of SoR style  ;Central document to project ; 24/7/365/seasonal/extremes/climate change/future???. |

## Gate 2
**be in a position that the sor is becoming well detailed as is the the core document with reference to other key documents, light outline of potential ideas/areas of ideas.**
Our focus
- Define sustainability
- collect data

### feedback
| Gate notes | Group Notes |
| ---- | ---- |
| Report | To IET type format missing Exec summary.  You can change the headings so perhaps procedure is not fully applicable here ; reasonable use of appendices ; reflecting  on issues. |
| Presentation | Use of room makes the audio difficult.  Slide on solutions should be basis of SoR. |
| Plan | Needs more detail such as training tasks ; will change every gate; show G1=>G2 in the report and discuss perhaps G2=>G3 in presentation or report |
| Progress | you need detail SoR before considering solutions  rubbish seems to be missing in detail.. Looking for answers without detailed SoR. |
| Skills Matrix | this needs to show training matrix => into the plan |
| DFMEA | not shown |
| QFD | not shown |
| SWOT | not shown |
| research | BREEAM standards with modelling. No references noted particularly power source detail. |
| Direction | A little lost looking at answers after a very good start, Granulate the SoR and show for G2,5 |
| Communication | listed meeting notes but not accessible  (15) |
| SoR | have granularity for the energy ; tabulate and add to SoR max min when etc ; The SoR needs much more detail to show full understanding of the question . Offer short G2.5 to get back on track |
| Risk |  |
| Calculations | interesting to calculate CO2 depending on power source mix ;  looking at grid mix  but this needs for be basically off grid source, ; |
## Gate 3
**understanding of the question and ideas of vague solutions/ areas to focus into**
- An understanding of the services provided by the engine shed 
- an understanding of the current climate impact of providing those services

### Ron's recommended progress email
Suggested progress for Gate 3

whole bunch of concepts but starting to pull them together and focus in on where to place solutions. iterating a lot (sor changes a lot)**

A 90% **completed SoR** as the core document for
you project. One with sufficient detail to allow
you to test your design of systems against.

**Start** the **initial** set of **concept systems** and test
these for suitability against the SoR engineering
targets using the initial “tools” outlined on the
iteration slide

(Note you will need more than these such as 3D
CAD, BoM with specifications etc etc if you want
to present details of the design at Gate 5)

This will allow you to start the “solutions précis”
on the core project document = The SoR.


## Gate 4
**2 potential solutions you’d like to present, pick the best of the solutions/most balanced solutions.**
## Gate 5
**final solutions picked, researched, priced and ready to pitch**
- A proposal to make the engine shed more sustainable
	- costed
	- evidence to sudgest viability
		- more sustainable than current solution
		- cost effective
		- would satisfy staekholders
			- SU
			- Uni
			- Students
			- Residents
- some further proposals for extreme sustainability
