# Innovation challenge individual report
2023-04-20 @ 22:43 
The innovation challenge forced us to take on allot more responsibility for our work than other modules as it was almost entirely self driven. Within our group we had to decide what our project was and what needed doing with very little external guidance, a stark contrast to the very structured & linear courseworks & assessments we where used to tackling. Dylan was great at scheduling meetings and coordinating the team we was an absolutely vital member of the team. As Dylan and Aiden live together they where able to coordinate directly and they worked very well together. Tommy Renson & myself where often less consistent with with the project all having ups and downs where some where able to give the project all their time while others weren't as able but between us it seemed to average out quite well.

I personally learned allot about the way I work and about the process of doing more abstract work. I very much appreciated the experience of being given a broad and abstract problem where the scope of what ae are asked to do extends to defining the problem and identifying what needs to be done not just doing it. Not only this but navigating the whole process as a team adds another layer of challenge that I'm glad to have experienced before having to face similar situations in industry.
Ron's style of delivery / management in this module is very different to the anything id experienced in the rest of my education but I strongly agree with Ron's sentiment that self sufficiency and autonomy are well taught through practice. its not enough, or even helpful, to explain in abstract instead this method combined just the right levels of inspiration, pressure and guidance for me to learn a great deal.
