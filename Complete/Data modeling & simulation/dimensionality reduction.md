## Principle Component Analysis
[[2024-08-08]] @ 20:58 
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) compresses a multidimensional dataset into its Principle Component. 

- Very Fast to compute
- Linear computational complexity
- Doesn't work well with non linear data. 

#definition A datasets Principle Component is the 

Calculate Covariance Matrix
	Centre the data
		Find the mean of each variable and subtracting that mean from each data point 
	Multiply the Centred data by the #WIP 

Find the [[Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of the Covariance Matrix
