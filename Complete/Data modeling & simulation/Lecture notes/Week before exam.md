## W4
Poles & zeroes
$e^{-at}: t_{s}= \frac{3}{a}$

## W5 - Bode plot
Positive means unstable
too high an angel of an angle ($<55 \degree$) means slow response, takes too long to settle. This indicates a disproportionately large imaginary component.
Lower than $-\sigma$ real part 
	*Why mechanistically is this a problem?*

*Careful with algebra in closed loop tf especially when simplifying* 

## W6 - steady state error
Order & Type

## W7 
[[Root locus]]
## W8 
## W9 - Frequency response function
$H(w) = G(j\omega)$
$Ae^{j\phi}$ 
Gain & phase margin
## W10 - stability testing
Nyquist will not show up

## W11 - 
*Block diagrams - will be in TCA*
	Reduction
***not** in TCA*
	*Sensitivity function*
	*Linearisation* 
	*State space*
