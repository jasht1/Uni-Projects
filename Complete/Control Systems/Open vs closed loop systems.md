### Open Loop Systems 
**Advantages**:
- Simplicity and stability: They are simpler in their layout and hence are economical.
- Construction: Since these are having a simple layout so are easier to construct.
- Do not have unstable feedback issues

**Disadvantages**:
- Accuracy and Reliability: since these systems do not have a feedback mechanism, so they are very inaccurate in terms of result output and hence they are unreliable too.
- Due to the absence of a feedback mechanism, they are unable to remove the disturbances occurring from external sources.

### [[Closed loop]] Systems 
**Advantages**:
- Less knowledge is requiered about the plant is reqiered.
- Disturbance reduction ability: Since they are composed of a feedback mechanism, so they clear out the errors between input and output signals, and hence remain unaffected to the external sources.

**Disadvantages**:
- Construction: They are relatively more complex in construction
- Since it consists of feedback loop, it may create oscillatory response of the system.
- Stability: It is less stable than open loop system, so we need to evaluate the stability.
