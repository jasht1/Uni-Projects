**long-term potentiation (LTP)**: A persistent increase in synaptic strength following high-frequency stimulation of a synapse #definition 

### Early Phase (E-LTP)

Lasts for Mins to hours

Caused by rapid signalling cascade of $Ca^{2+}$ 

Releases kinases, an enzyme that catalyses phosphate group transfer. 

### Late Phase (L-LTP)

Lasts from days to weeks

Synthesis of new proteins and changes in gene expression.

This maintains the synaptic modification and
