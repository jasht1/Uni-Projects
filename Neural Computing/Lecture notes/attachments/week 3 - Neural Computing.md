## Leaky Integrate and Fire LIF Model

simplified version of the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]]

useful approximation of neuron behaviour for studying emergent phenomena

what frequency distribution should you expect from a neuron responding to Gaussian noise?
its resonance frequency

What is the effect of prior neurons who's resonant frequency is out of band?
