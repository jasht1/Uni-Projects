## What is a model

A model is a means of quantifying a hypothesis for theoretical investigation.

all models are approximations they are always a little wrong, reality is unapproachably complex and indefinite. A model uses compromises and assumptions that reduce reality to a comprehend-able and calculable form.

## How do we create a model

### Stimuli

### Data Collection

### Feature Extraction

### Encoding Model

### Validation (Predicting unknown data)
