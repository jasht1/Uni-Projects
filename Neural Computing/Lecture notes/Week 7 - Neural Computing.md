## Questions 

Why would we expect the left and right sides of the body to be controlled in different physical areas of the brain when the left and right sides of the body are almost always working in unison or at the very least cooperatively 

Given that the brain is symetrical as an engineer I would have expected this would be to the benifit of redundancy, is that the case, can the left take on the responsibilities of the right and vicea versa.

demyelination is damage to the covering is called the myelin sheath

The brain is an asynchronous 

Von Neihman archetecture, the pentagons brain, built the archetecture for DARPA, 

Information is stored in the synapses, HOW?
- Pysical properties
	- Protonation

STDP short time dependant plasticity, associates prior nurnal stimuli by their time dependence. Depending on the time delta between receiving the stimuli the neuron can gain insights into the greater pattern of activation.

Neurons that display a proclivity to respond to a certain stimulous will be associated more strongly with that stimulus causing the brain to call on them in future when similar stimuli arise. 
	How dose the brain distinguish between neurons that are doing something useful and those that are not.

myelin sheath

Myelin is **an insulating layer, or sheath that forms around nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord**. It is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells.

Myelin is a layer of proteins and fats that insulate nerves, this allows them to transmit signals quickly and efficiency.

Typically caused by a misguided immunoresponse that attacks a given component of the brain, in multiple sclerosis MS this is would be the myelin sheaths, in dementia and Parkinsons this would be dopamanergic neurons.
