Lab Session: Synapses - 07/11/2023
### Exercise 1: Simulating Synaptic Transmission
Write a simple Matlab script to define synaptic weights (randomly between 0 and 1) and simulate the propagation of signals through the synapses. You can use basic principles of signal propagation and integrate differential equations to model the postsynaptic potential. Plot the postsynaptic potential response.
### Exercise 2: Modelling Neurotransmitter Dynamics
Write a simple Matlab script to stimulate the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters over time. You can utilise differential equations to model the dynamics and create visualisations using plotting functions in Matlab.
### Exercise 3: Postsynaptic Receptor Activation
Write a simple Matlab script to stimulate the interaction between neurotransmitter concentrations and postsynaptic receptors. By defining different concentrations and receptor properties, you can observe the resulting postsynaptic response.
### Exercise 4: Analysing the Impact of Noise
Write a simple Matlab script to study how different levels of noise affect synaptic communication. You can add noise components to the synaptic signals and analyse the reliability of signal transmission under various noise conditions.
