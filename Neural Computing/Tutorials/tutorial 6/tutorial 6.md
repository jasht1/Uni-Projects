## Brief

### Task 1: Basic Exploration of LTP Parameters

### Objectives
Understand the effect of different parameters on calcium concentration and synaptic weight.

### Instructions:

1. Run the initial model as-is and observe the calcium concentration and synaptic weight plots.

2. Ask students to adjust the following parameters individually and observe how they influence the results:
	- Ca_increment: Change the amount by which calcium increases with each spike. What happens to the synaptic weight if calcium is increased more slowly or quickly?
	
	- tau_Ca: Adjust the calcium decay constant. What happens if calcium decays faster or slower?
	
	- alpha_LTP: Experiment with the learning rate for LTP. How does a higher or lower rate affect synaptic weight growth?

> [!INFO] Expected Outcome
> Students learn how calcium concentration and decay influence synaptic potentiation and understand the basic dynamics of LTP.

### Task 2: Exploring Threshold Effects

### Objectives
Investigate the role of the calcium threshold for LTP induction.

### Instructions:

1. Have students modify the threshold_Ca value and observe how the calcium threshold affects LTP.

2. Ask students to try threshold values above and below the initial setting and record observations.

3. Discussion prompt: Why is a threshold necessary for LTP? How does it relate to the "all-or-nothing" concept in synaptic plasticity?

> [!INFO] Expected Outcome
> Students gain an understanding of how threshold values act as a gatekeeper, allowing LTP only under certain conditions, and relate this to biological selectivity for high-frequency stimulation.
