Workshop Title: 

## Breif

### Workshop objectives
1. Understand how membrane properties (capacitance, leak conductance) influence neuron spiking.
2. Explore the effects of oscillatory input and noise on the firing rate.
3. Observe how changing the input frequency affects the neuron's ability to spike.
4. Learn how the interaction between noise and oscillatory input can generate realistic  neuronal behaviour.
### Tasks
#### Task 1: Membrane Capacitance and Time Constant
- How does decreasing the membrane capacitance influence the neuron's firing rate?
- What happens if the time constant is too large or too small for a given input?
#### Task 2: Input Amplitude and Noise
- What happens when you increase the noise? Does the neuron fire more regularly or  less?
- How does changing the input amplitude influence the neuron’s ability to reach the  threshold?
#### Task 3: Frequency of Oscillatory Input
- What happens to spiking as the frequency increases?
- At what frequencies does the neuron spike most efficiently? Why?
#### Task 4: Discussion / Report
- Membrane Capacitance: How did smaller capacitance values make the neuron more  responsive to high-frequency input?
- Input Amplitude and Noise: How did the balance between noise and the input  amplitude affect regular vs. irregular spiking?
- Frequency: Why does the neuron spike less often at higher frequencies, and how can  noise or increased input amplitude compensate for this

The neuron behaves similarly to an RC filter. The membrane capacitance $C_{m}$ is linearly correlated with the time constant.
