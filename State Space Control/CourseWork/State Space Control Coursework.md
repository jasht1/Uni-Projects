### Aims
%%[[2024-12-14]] @ 18:34%%

The aim of this project is to tune an active vehicle suspension using a mathematical model to improve ride quality and control. The vehicle will have independent suspension utilising an actuator in addition to the passive linear spring and damper at each wheel.

## System Dynamics

A state space representation will be used to model the behaviour of the system where the state variables will be the displacement and velocity of the car body and wheel.
