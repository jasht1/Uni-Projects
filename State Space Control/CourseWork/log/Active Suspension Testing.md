## Active Suspension Performance

### Stability

### Bump Test
%%[[2024-12-18]] @ 23:59%%

The behaviour of the system is simulated to observe the response to a bump in the road. The bump in the simulation below is 5 cm half sinusoid with a duration of half a second.

The simulations where created using the [[bump_response.m]] script that can be found [here](https://github.com/jasht1/Uni-Projects/blob/master/State%20Space%20Control/CourseWork/code/bump_response.m) in the working directory.

The Active suspension provides a substantial improvement in every respect. It eliminates the oscillations seen in the [[Passive Suspension Testing#Bump tests]] and reduces the magnitude of the body displacement, velocity and acceleration.

The effect of the bump is diminished significantly from the perspective of the passenger with the displacement felt being reduced to less than 20% of the actual disturbance.
