This is a very open ended question, and so it must be refined before we can attempt to answer it. It can certainly be a useful practice to identify a system of taxonomy of a broad topic to gleam insight into how knowledge on the topic can be structured & organised. Recently having read Ultralearning by Scott Young I'm inclined to relate this to his idea of meta-learning, a practice of deliberately spending time to learn the lay of the land so to speak of a new topic to lay a stronger foundation from which to dive into more directed study.

Taking a "robotic system" to mean a mechanical device that carries out tasks and it's associated peripherals, an example of which could be a 6DOF actuated arm with an end effector along with a power source and digital controller set up to move blocks over a wall. There are endless ways robotic systems could be classified into types, and arrangements capable of any conceivable task. For an engaging and imaginative list of robotic systems and their tasks have a look through this list of Star Wars droids: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)#List_of_droid_characters [2]
