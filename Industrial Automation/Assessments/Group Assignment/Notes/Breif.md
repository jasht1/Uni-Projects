### Task 

![Bottle Filling and Capping System Diagram](Bottle%20Filling%20and%20Capping%20System%20Diagram.png)

You have been engaged as Automation Consultants to provide expertise to the management team who have asked you to provide a professional proposal for automation of Bottle filling system in which they desire the following functionality:

- When start button is pressed the system starts. Sensor `SEN` detects presence of bottle and Cylinder `A` pushes it to the conveyor.
    
- Cylinder `B` moves the conveyor till bottle is detected by `CP2`.
    
- Conveyor stops and solenoid at `D` is energised to allow liquid to be filled in the bottle.
    
- Conveyor moves again till bottle is detected by `CP3`. It then stops again.
    
- Cylinder `G` pushes the caps while Cylinder `E` and motor `F` caps the bottle.
    
- Conveyor further moves and bottle is picked up at the end.
    


### Objectives

The management team would like to see a detailed operational scheme including details of sensors, actuators and PLC control devices, connection diagrams and PLC ladder programme for the Bottle Filling System.

- Identify all input and output element types and suggest specifications of all.
    
- Draw PLC circuit diagram showing all input and output connections.
    
- Assign suitable addresses to them in the PLC software.
    
- Draw ladder logic to implement the process control.
    
- Provide a SCADA dashboard for online monitoring of the system, detail out the type of network system and its KPIs for successful monitoring of the system.
    
- Provide alarms where required so that the process may suitably stop in case of an emergency.

### Format

Your submission should take the form of a **group report**, addressing the requirements set out in the description of the assessment task. There is a **15-page limit** for your report.
