## Reviewing the brief
%%[[2025-02-26]] @ 23:53%%

I have read the [brief](Projects/Uni%20Projects/Industrial%20Automation/Assessments/Pneumatics%20Coursework/Brief.md) more carefully and it seems the task is far simpler than I imagined.

I simply need to:

1. List the components necessary to automate the process implied by [Appendix 1](Appendix%201.md) by type; sensing, actuating & control.

2. Find a similar simple task, and describe the process necessary to automate it, then model it in FluidSIM.
