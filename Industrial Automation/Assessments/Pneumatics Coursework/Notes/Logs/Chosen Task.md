A sheet is fed by conveyor of driven rollers, these have enough friction to pull the sheet forward when it is free but not to crumple/tear it.
When the sheet roll reaches the roller switch, the shear is actuated.
This cuts a section of sheet allowing the cut section to advance while blocking the progress of the roll.
Once the sheet section is clear from the switch the shear retracts, this allows the sheet roll to advance again and the cycle repeats.
