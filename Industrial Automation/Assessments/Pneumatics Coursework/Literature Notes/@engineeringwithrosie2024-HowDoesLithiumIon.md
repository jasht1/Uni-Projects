## Are batteries worth recycling?
%%[[2025-02-24]] @ 12:19%%

We have a finite amount of lithium & cobalt, they are only available from the cobalt triangle which makes the supply chain of these raw materials fragile. 

For a recycling method to be viable it should be favourable to extracting the virgin raw materials, It should be comparably:
- energy efficient,
- lower emissions,
- cheaper &
- Of comparable quality.

## Methods

### Pyrometallurgy

This method involves putting batteries in a big furnace that burns the combustibles and separates molten products.

#### Pros / Cons

##### Pros

- Mature Technology
- Scalable

##### Cons

- Material Loss
- Energy Intensive
- Environmental Impact

#### What can be recovered

The heavy metals like:

- copper, 
- cobalt & 
- nickel 

are easy to remove via pyrometallurgy but this method sacrifices the

- graphite,
- electrolytes, 
- plastics, 
- lithium, 
- aluminium & 
- manganese

### Hydometallurgy

This method involves shredding batteries and using various solution baths to selectively extract materials.

#### Pros / Cons

##### Pros
- High recovery yield
- High purity
- Energy efficient

##### Cons
- Expensive
- Chemical waste
- Higher Emissions

### Direct Recycling

Batteries are dissembled electrode materials are rejuvenated. 

#### Pros / Cons
Being a new technology little can be authoritative stated and much is likely to change over coming years.

##### Pros
- 

##### Cons
- New Technology
