> "— External air temperature: this forms an essential input for natural ventilation control systems. The sensor should be mounted on the north face of the building and be provided with a radiation shield against solar and sky radiation.  — Rain intensity sensors: these are fitted so that windows and vents may be shut automatically to prevent rain ingress. For a large building it may be advisable to mount sensors at opposite ends to detect approaching rain.  — Wind speed: windows and vents may be shut or partially closed at high wind speeds to avoid damage or to control over-ventilation. If combined with a rain sensor, wind speed sensors can be used to give protection against driving rain ingress.  — Wind direction: this can be used to select windward or leeward vents as appropriate.  — Solar radiation: a solar radiation sensor may be used to increase ventilation rates at times of high solar gain or to automatically control the operation of solar screens or window blinds.  — Slab temperature: the building fabric plays an essential part in passive temperature control and some natural ventilation control strategies use a measure of fabric temperature rather than internal air temperature. The sensor should be inserted to a depth of approximately 25 to 50 mm into the slab, packed with thermal paste and cemented in. As a less satisfactory alternative, a surface mounted sensor, covered with insulation, may be used. A 5-54 Building control systems  position should be chosen on an internal wall or ceiling remote from temperature disturbances.  — CO2 concentration: this can be used as a set point  for ventilation control in addition to internal air temperature and is of value in buildings with a large but variable occupancy.  — Occupation: the number of people in the controlled space may be used to set the target ventilation rate. This is feasible where the building has controlled entry and exit; in an integrated system it may be possible to obtain information from the security system."
