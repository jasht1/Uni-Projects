>> 
>> - External air temperature: this forms an essential input for natural ventilation control systems. The sensor should be mounted on the north face of the building and be provided with a radiation shield against solar and sky radiation.  
>> - Rain intensity sensors: these are fitted so that windows and vents may be shut automatically to prevent rain ingress. For a large building it may be advisable to mount sensors at opposite ends to detect approaching rain.  
>> - Wind speed: windows and vents may be shut or partially closed at high wind speeds to avoid damage or to control over-ventilation. If combined with a rain sensor, wind speed sensors can be used to give protection against driving rain ingress.  
>> - Wind direction: this can be used to select windward or leeward vents as appropriate.  
>> - Solar radiation: a solar radiation sensor may be used to increase ventilation rates at times of high solar gain or to automatically control the operation of solar screens or window blinds.  
>> - Slab temperature: the building fabric plays an essential part in passive temperature control and some natural ventilation control strategies use a measure of fabric temperature rather than internal air temperature. The sensor should be inserted to a depth of approximately 25 to 50 mm into the slab, packed with thermal paste and cemented in. As a less satisfactory alternative, a surface mounted sensor, covered with insulation, may be used. A 5-54 Building control systems  position should be chosen on an internal wall or ceiling remote from temperature disturbances.  
>> - CO2 concentration: this can be used as a set point  for ventilation control in addition to internal air temperature and is of value in buildings with a large but variable occupancy.  
>> - Occupation: the number of people in the controlled space may be used to set the target ventilation rate. This is feasible where the building has controlled entry and exit; in an integrated system it may be possible to obtain information from the security system.

> # 5.14.3 Control strategies
> > [!note]
> > ## Summary
> > - The primary aim of a ventilation system is to regulate CO2 concentration and dissipate heat gains. These are directly associated with occupation.
> > - There is a trade off between energy usage and controllability.
> > - It is typical to have different control strategies for occupation period vs night period.
>
>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=7NTM4A2E)
>> "The level of occupation may be used to estimate the rate of CO2 production and hence the required ventilation."
> 
>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=K5CK3ZKN)
>> "The use of night ventilation to dissipate heat gains acquired during the heat of the day and to precool the building fabric is an important strategy in avoiding the use of mechanical cooling and it is possible to keep the internal temperature below daytime external ambient temperature by this means."
> 
>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=SBE2SK5R)
>> "Where modulating control of natural ventilation openings is provided, it will not be possible to use fast acting control loops to try and achieve more accurate control."
> 
>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=SI9YTA8N)
>> "The target air quality is typically a CO2  concentration below a set point of 1000 ppm."
> 
>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=X8PDFWYU)
>> "Bringing in outside air at a higher temperature than the internal zone temperature will result in a heat gain, and there is an argument that vents should be closed to minimise the ingress of warm outside air. However, this does not allow for the effect of internal heat gains which will tend to increase the inside temperature to a level above that outside. In general it will be more effective to use warm outside air for ventilation than to allow the gains to build up inside without ventilation."

> > [!note]
> > ## Summary
> > Utilise thermal mass to provide cooling during the day by pre-cooling it during the night.

>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=K5TEWDQN)

>> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N6V2GLS?page=130&annotation=4HZB3S97)

>> - Contingency: this describes a building that has been designed primarily for natural ventilation, with the provision for the addition of mechanical services later if found necessary.  
>> - Zoned: some zones of the building are provided with mechanical services where there is a specific requirement. An example might be a building with naturally ventilated office spaces, a mechanically ventilated kitchen area and an air conditioned computer room.  
>> - Complementary: both natural ventilation and mechanical services serve the same zone. The systems may be operated in either changeover or concurrent mode. Concurrent systems often provide a basic level of mechanical ventilation to ensure a permanent draught free ventilation air supply, while allowing occupants to open windows as they choose. Changeover systems operate in distinct modes to satisfy different requirements. For example, windows may be openable in mild weather, but locked shut when mechanical plant is used for either heating or cooling. Changeover systems present practical problems of producing effective control strategies and ensuring that occupants are fully conversant with the different requirements of the various modes of operation.

>> - People are good at judging whether they need the lights on: do not switch lights on or increase brightness automatically unless this is essential for safety, or appropriate for managed areas.  
>> - People are not good at switching lights off: try to provide automatic switch-off, but . . .  
>> - People do not like being plunged into darkness: where possible lights should be dimmed down, or a warning given. There should be readily accessible local override switches.  
>> - People dislike automatic systems which distract them or do not do what they want: automatic switching or stepped dimming is best done at fixed times rather than at seemingly random intervals. Occupancy detectors should be positioned to avoid nuisance triggering.  
>> - Local controls should be accessible and their operation intuitive: switches should be close to the point of decision and their operation clear.  
>> - Individual requirements differ: given the choice, users select a wide range of illuminance levels. Lower levels are often chosen for work with computer screens; people with less acute eyesight or more exacting work may need additional task lighting.
