## 5.15 Control methods

#### Summary
  There are 4 basic control methods:
  1. Local manual controls
  2. Timeswitches
  3. Occupancy detection
  4. Lighting level

### 5.15.1.1 Localised manual controls

#### Summary
  Light switches, or remotes.
  Wire lights that will be controlled together, put the controls close by.

 "Luminaires controlled by a single switch should cover an area with roughly constant daylight factor"
 
 "luminaires related to a particular activity or work group to be controlled together."
 
 "The manual switches should be placed as near as possible to the area being controlled."
 
 "the distance from the light switch to the furthest fitting that it controls is no more than 6 m, or twice the height of the fitting above floor level, whichever is greater."
 
 "Where multiple switches are located together, clear labelling is of benefit."

### 5.15.1.2 Timeswitches

#### Summary
  Switch lights off at certain times, provide a means for users to turn them back on.

 "switch lights on shortly before work commences and to switch the full lighting off after working hours."
 
 "lights may need to be left on for security and safety"
 
 "some form of override should be provided for people working late; this should incorporate an extension timer to prevent the lights being left on all night."
 
 "Timeswitches are effective for external lighting, but require adjustment with season."

 **Reset control**: Switch lighting off at sensible times i.e. lunch & end of day, occupants will switch back on the ones they actually need.#definition 

 "people are motivated to switch lights on rather than off"

### 5.15.1.3 Occupancy detection

#### Summary
  Switch lights on when occupants are detected and off when they arn't.
  Avoid constant switching if not using LEDs.

 "the interval is chosen to avoid frequent switching, which can shorten lamp life."
 
 "A minimum on period of 10 minutes should be set; general practice is to use on-times of up to 30 minutes."
 
 **absence sensing** : The presence sensor switches the light off when no occupancy has been detected for a set time, and a manual switch is used to turn them back on.#definition 
 
 "Presence sensing finds application in infrequently used areas such as store rooms or spaces where people may have their hands full when entering."
 
 PIR : Passive Infrared, the most common presence sensor.#definition 
 
 "The range of operation of a PIR is up to about 10 m. For larger spaces a microwave detector" which can achive 50 m.
 
 "Acoustic sensors are available which respond to noise."
 
 "Presence detectors are normally combined with a photocell, which prevents operation of the lighting when there is sufficient ambient light."

### 5.15.1.4 Lighting level

#### Summary
  Prioritise the use of natural lighting, only switch on artificial lighting when this falls below acceptable levels.

 "Photocells are used to monitor the light level in the space and regulate the lighting accordingly."
 
 "a switch-on occurs when the daylight illuminance is about twice the required task illuminance and switch-off takes place when the combined artificial and daylight illuminance is three or four times the required task illuminance."
 
 "incorporate a time delay into the control system to avoid rapid switching"
 
 "More effective control can be effected by the use of dimmers."
 
 "lamps are oversized when new" to provide the required illumination at the end of the cycle.

### 5.15.1.5 Scene set control

#### Summary
  The use of different preset lighting schemes... exist?

 "different lighting schemes may be required at different times of day."

### 5.15.2.1 System selection

#### Summary
  Considerations when designing a HVAC control strategy:
  occupancy,
  daylight,
  desired level of control,
  cost versus potential savings,
  
  how all of these are likely to change,

 - the expected occupancy pattern  
 - the availability of daylight  
 - the desired level of control sophistication  
 - the capital cost of the system versus potential savings  
 - need to accommodate changes in the building or use patterns.

### 5.15.2.2 Lamps and control gear

#### Summary
  Probably worth looking at something more modern than this as it predates the widespread adoption of LED lighting.

 "Building Regulations Part L(24) requires that offices, industrial and  storage areas shall achieve an average initial efficacy of not less than 45 luminaire-lumens per circuit watt as averaged over the whole area of these types of space in the building."

 "The life of a fluorescent lamp is adversely affected by frequent switching."
 
 "Neither conventional starter switch circuits nor cold start electronic circuits are suitable for use with presence detection."
 
 "The Lighting Industry Federation(52) recommends that where fluorescent lamps are to be switched frequently, the longer warm-up time should be considered and that a minimum on-time of 20 minutes should be employed"

### 5.15.2.3 Lighting control systems

#### Summary
  Basically just use the methods discussed in 5.15.1 in concert.

### 5.15.2.4 Human factors

#### Summary
  Account for human behavior:
  good at turning lights on,
  bad at turning them off,
  get annoyed at pretty much anything they notice,
  want control,

 - People are good at judging whether they need the lights on: do not switch lights on or increase brightness automatically unless this is essential for safety, or appropriate for managed areas.  
 - People are not good at switching lights off: try to provide automatic switch-off, but . . .  
 - People do not like being plunged into darkness: where possible lights should be dimmed down, or a warning given. There should be readily accessible local override switches.  
 - People dislike automatic systems which distract them or do not do what they want: automatic switching or stepped dimming is best done at fixed times rather than at seemingly random intervals. Occupancy detectors should be positioned to avoid nuisance triggering.  
 - Local controls should be accessible and their operation intuitive: switches should be close to the point of decision and their operation clear.  
 - Individual requirements differ: given the choice, users select a wide range of illuminance levels. Lower levels are often chosen for work with computer screens; people with less acute eyesight or more exacting work may need additional task lighting.
