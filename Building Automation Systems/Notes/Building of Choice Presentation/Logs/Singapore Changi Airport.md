#### MERV-14-rated Filters

These higher grade filters can effectively remove about 85 per cent of the particles of 0.3 to 1.0 micrometres in size in the air, smaller than the size of a COVID-19 particle in a respiratory droplet.

#### Ultraviolet-C

Currently in the process of installing

## In floor cooling

The JCA utilises a significant amount of water cooled concrete to cool the building especially in the areas that receive direct sunlight to counteract the radiative heat gain.
