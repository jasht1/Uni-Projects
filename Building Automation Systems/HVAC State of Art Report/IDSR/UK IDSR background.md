The UK government has supported the development of technical standards PAS 1878 [@2021-PAS1878] and 1879 [@2021-PAS1879] to enable domestic and small to medium enterprise (SME) consumers to participate in demand side response. 

- PAS 1878 specifies energy smart appliances (ESA) themselves, the attributes and functionalities required of devices to participate in DSR. [@2021-PAS1878]
- PAS 1879 specifies roles and operations through thought the energy supply chain necessary to facilitate DSR in domestic or small business buildings. [@2021-PAS1879]

So called "energy smart" appliances especially HVAC featured heavily in the "Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan 2021" [@jonathanbrearley2021-SmartSystemsFlexibilityPlan2021] with Â£13 million awarded to a number of public private partnerships to support development. [@departmentforbusinessenergy&industrialstrategy-IDSRProjects] Multiple government publications indicate that demand side response functionality will be legally mandated for heat pumps and batteries by 2027 [@jonathanbrearley2021-SmartSystemsFlexibilityPlan2021; @departmentforenergysecurityandnetzero2022-DeliveringSmartSecureElectricitySystem; @departmentforbusinessenergy&industrialstrategy2021-HeatBuildingsStrategy] as was done for EV chargers in 2021 [@2022-EVChargerRegulations].
