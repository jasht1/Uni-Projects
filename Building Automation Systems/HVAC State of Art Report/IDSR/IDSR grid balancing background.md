Electricity grids around the world are performing a perpetual balancing act to match supply and demand with little margin for error, when this can't be achieved it means power outages that can cost lives as well as capital. [@alanwalker-CountingCostEconomic]
In the UK the gird is coordinated via comprehensive market saturated with [Power Brokers](Knowledge/Engineering/Energy%20Systems/Grids/Power%20Brokers.md) that predict demands, supplys, shortfalls, excesses, and a myriad of derivatives there of based on a huge amount of data mostly focused around generation and transmission.

With the energy revolution taking place to meet climate goals there there are significant changes in our energy supply and it's usage that test the limits of the systems currently in place to maintain that balance. 
The "old way" was built on the assertion that the majority of generation could be switched on and off as and when it was needed, and that storing electricity or influencing consumer demand where for the most part impractical. However all of these old truths are changing, primarily because grids have to make use of intermittent renewables that generate power that is clean but difficult to predict and often aren't well matched with existing demand.
