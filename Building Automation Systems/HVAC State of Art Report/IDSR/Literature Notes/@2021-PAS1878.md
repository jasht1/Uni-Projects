> 
> - Interoperability: the ability of an ESA to work seamlessly across any appropriate DSR service operated by any authorized system actor.  
> - Data privacy: the secure transmission and storing of data on the device or with any controlling party.  
> - Grid stability: the prevention of outages on the grid caused by inappropriate operation of ESAs.  
> - Cyber security: the appropriate protection of ESAs from unauthorized access and the correct use of ESAs by authorized parties only in order to achieve valid DSR events.

## Operation
### Interfaces
[IDSR interfaces](IDSR%20interfaces.md)

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=10&annotation=Z2IG49E7)

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=11&annotation=85NC8TRQ)
> Both the CEM and the ESA shall communicate with a remote manufacturer, or service provider portal, using a logical interface defined by the manufacturer/ service provider.  As a minimum, this interface shall be used to supply the CEM and ESA with firmware updates, certificate management information

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=11&annotation=REP5G359)

### Information Flow

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=13&annotation=4JT6RSF4)
> During normal operation, the ESA shall:
> a) inform the DSRSP, via the CEM, of its current flexibility offers;
> b) inform the DSRSP, via the CEM, of any current flexibility offer updates;
> c) act upon a request to implement a flexibility offer from the DSRSP, via the CEM, providing the CEM with updated profiles in response;
> d) for any accepted flexibility offer requests, indicate that it is operating in a DSR event period using its user interface;
> e) either periodically report its instantaneous power consumption to the DSRSP via the CEM during a DSR event, or log its power consumption during a DSR event and report this to the DSRSP via the CEM as an actual power profile at the end of the DSR event;
> f) send an acknowledgement for each accepted flexibility offer request to the DSRSP; and
> g) indicate to the DSRSP that it has cancelled the previously selected flexibility offer.
> The CEM shall pass information between the DSRSP and ESA, unencrypting and encrypting between Interface A and Interface B.

### Operation modes

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=13&annotation=JZYPH7KP)
> Mode 1: Routine mode  The CEM shall be able to perform energy management functions and manage the consumption/production/ storage of its connected ESA(s) according to consumer preferences

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=13&annotation=9HB2QFUI)
> Mode 2: Response mode  The ESA shall immediately enter Mode 2 (Response mode) once it has acknowledged to its registered DSRSP that it will be accepting and performing a valid flexibility offer

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=14&annotation=BBC8HLHP)
> The ESA shall remain in Mode 2 until:  
> - the period stated by the DSRSP request ends;  
> - the DSRSP requests the period to end; or  
> - the consumer overrides the DSR operation; or  
> - the failsafe protections occur.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=14&annotation=UC6E6E4S)
> Mode 3: Consumer override  The ESA shall enter Mode 3 whenever it receives a manual override (i.e. modify, decline or cancel) from the Consumer.  In Mode 3, the ESA shall allow the Consumer to override any Mode 1 (routine) or Mode 2 (response) operation at any time.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=14&annotation=8NGLK3S8)
> Mode 4: Failsafe  The CEM and ESA control logic shall ensure that the CEM and ESA do not perform in a manner that can lead to an unsafe, harmful or otherwise hazardous situation. Whenever such a condition is imminent, the CEM and ESA shall transition into a failsafe state (Mode 4).

### Power Profiles 
[power profile](power%20profile.md)

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=24&annotation=233RCG84)
> each CEM shall provide the DSRSP with information relating to the actual power values or profiles provided by its ESAs

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=24&annotation=N4UV7MCY)
> The ESA shall indicate its flexibility capability by generating a set of indexed forecast power profiles

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=25&annotation=9YLAKFTE)
> An ESA shall generate at least three forecast power profiles:  
> - intended operation (IO);  
> - most delayed (MD); and  
> - least delayed (LD).

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=26&annotation=KZ8HQR4C)
> ESAs able to produce power, such as battery storage, shall also generate two additional forecast power profiles:  
> - most delayed production (MD_P);  
> - least delayed production (LD_P).

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=27&annotation=6GAS2I3X)
> a) the ESA shall calculate the initial IO, MD and LD forecast power profiles for a given flexibility forecast period as part of a flexibility offer;
> b) these shall be sent to the DSRSP via the CEM as a flexibility offer update whenever their status changes or they expire;
> c) following the beginning of the flexibility forecast period, the ESA shall send updates for the IO, LD and MD forecast power profiles as they change with time and ESA status; and
> d) upon requesting a flexibility offer, the DSRSP can select either LD or MD as it sees fit and send the request to the ESA via the CEM, which shall respond as quickly as possible, either implementing the DSRSP’s request or rejecting it if it is not applicable

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=26&annotation=WETEQNJF)
> Forecast power profiles shall denote power consumption using positive power values and power production using negative power values.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=26&annotation=7LF5IA8C)
> When operating in Great Britain, the ESA shall apply a randomized offset in the range 0 s to 600 s by default

#### Intended Operation (IO) 

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=26&annotation=EZEDHMPV)
> Intended operation: The “intended operation” (IO) power profile shall correspond to the operation of the ESA when not responding to a flexibility offer request from a DSRSP.

#### Most Delayed (MD)

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FJA7F9TN?page=26&annotation=S6Q89AT9)
