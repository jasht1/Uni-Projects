> There are two types of demand response markets. Implicitdemand response markets encourage changes in demand through variable electricity prices,30 for example, timeof-use tariffs charge higher prices during peak times.31,32 Explicitdemand response schemes make payments to customers who change their electricity demand at particular times.

> The Government projects that low-carbon flexibility, including demand side response, could reduce the cost of running the electricity system by £10 billion per year in 2050, around 14% of the system cost, with a cumulative cost saving of £30-70 billion between 2020 and 2050.

> Towards a more innovative energy retail market46  Call for evidence ran Jul-Sept 2023  The call for evidence examines, amongst other things, changes to retail electricity marketsg that might encourage domestic and small non-domestic consumers to provide demand side response. The Government has ruled out an overhaul of the retail market in the short or medium term.47

> Distribution network operators may not be viewed as neutral operators of flexibility markets because they are also responsible for maintaining the distribution network. In their capacity as distribution network owners and maintainers, distribution network operators are compensated for constructing new infrastructure. Flexibility markets may reduce the amount of infrastructure which is built. There may be a perception of a conflict of interest on the part of the distribution network operator if they also operate the flexibility markets.

> An asset meter measures the energy consumption of a single device. The Electric Vehicle (Smart Charge Points) Regulations 2021 requires electric vehicle chargers installed in homes to be configured with asset meters.43The Government has committed to requiring heat pumps to have asset meters in the future9,65.

> Demand side response includes the abilities to change charge profiles or shift a devices’ electricity usage in time.21 To determine whether demand side response has been provided, the electricity usage that would have occurred without demand side response is needed.66 This counterfactual is the baseline. Baselines can be hard to obtain for households because their energy demand is erratic.67–69

> Regulations 2021 required all new domestic and workplace electric vehicle chargers to have smart functionality and so to be able to respond to these signals.43 The Government has committed to similar measures for heat pumps.9

> Households with less ability to shift may end up paying more for their electricity.

> Households in energy poverty often continuously minimise their electricity demand.81 This means that their baseline electricity demand will be low and they will be less able to reduce their demand in order to receive compensation.82

> If the response is provided manually, as it was in the Demand Flexibility Service, there is a chance that people will respond in a manner different to that expected.56%% end annotations %%
