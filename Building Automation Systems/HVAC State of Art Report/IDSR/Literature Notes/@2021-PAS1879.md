## Summary
%%[[2025-03-31]] @ 13:53%%

This document focused on the operations throughout the energy supply chain primarily transmission system operators (TSOs), distribution network/system operators (DNOs) and electricity suppliers and aggregators. It is less relevant than the prior [@2021-PAS1878](@2021-PAS1878.md) as it is of less concern to building operators directly focusing more on the role of DSR service providers (DSRSPs).

> - match the short-term availability of intermittent renewable energy generation sources such as wind and solar;  
> - decrease the peak load on the electrical transmission and distribution networks to alleviate the need for network upgrades to handle new domestic appliance types, such as electric vehicle (EV) chargepoints and electric heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems;  
> - allow control of electricity network characteristics such as line frequency, system inertia and network voltage, and help prevent network and generation outages; and  
> - allow the offset of short-term market imbalances by controlling flexible load on the network.

> These aims are achieved by shifting (in time) and/or modulating (increasing or decreasing) the collective electricity consumption or production of domestic appliances, in line with consumer preferences and agreement, in response to signals from grid-side actors.

> At longer timescales and with sufficient notice, consumer behaviour change can be achieved through electricity suppliers altering the tariff that electricity consumers pay, which encourages the use of appliances at times outside of peak demand or at times when excess generation capacity is expected to be available. This is called the ”routine” method and is delivered through electricity suppliers setting time of use (ToU) tariffs.

> To provide DSR services, a domestic appliance can shift in time and/or modulate in magnitude its electricity consumption or production, in response to external signals.

> Domestic and light commercial electrical appliances are termed ESAs when they meet the requirements specified in PAS 1878:2021.

> This PAS sets out a common definition of demand side response (DSR) services for actors operating within the consumer energy supply chain and provides recommendations to support the operation of energy smart appliances (ESAs).%% end annotations %%
