> Consumers will be able to play an active role, taking up new tariffs and smart appliances like smart electric vehicle chargers so they can save money by using electricity at cheaper times. Ofgem will work together with government and industry, to help consumers make the changes needed. Innovative markets, products and services will help ensure the transition to net zero is affordable, fair and inclusive to all.

> Consumers will be able to shift demand to times of day when electricity is cheaper and more abundant.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=5&annotation=36Q3ANVE)
> This flexibility will be facilitated by regulatory and market reform, investment in innovation, and system digitalisation.

> By 2030 and beyond consumers will be providing significant flexibility to the system (potentially around 13GW in combination with intraday storage18), with the domestic sector expanding rapidly as low carbon heating deployment increases and drivers choose electric vehicles. Consumer flexibility will be normalised, with “energy smart” products and services commonplace. A culture of cyber security will be embedded across the smart and flexible energy system, supporting the resilience of the network and bolstering consumer confidence. It is expected that there will be over 15 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030,19 and it will be the norm for drivers to use smart charging. Deeper integration between electric vehicles and the electricity system will be achieved by way of vehicle-togrid technologies. Flexibility providers will have offers to cater for all levels of consumer engagement, with consumers in charge and able to choose how dynamic their participation should be. The consumer, system, and environmental benefits of consumer flexibility will be well established in the public consciousness. Localised low carbon solutions are optimised across power, heat and transport systems bringing positive outcomes for consumers,  communities and the country as a whole.

> The British Standards Institution has now published two standards (PAS 1878 and 1879), developed by industry, which set a technical framework for small-scale DSR, guided by the principles of interoperability, data privacy, grid stability and cyber security, and which is compatible with the GB Smart Metering system.27

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=22&annotation=SHUY46EF)
> The Crown Commercial Service launched a new framework to enable public sector consumers to access DSR.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=22&annotation=IC5WVZU9)
> The government funded the British Standards Institution to develop new technical standards to support the uptake of "energy smart" appliances and to facilitate DSR from smaller consumers.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=23&annotation=9N2P7X5H)
> We will support the deployment and uptake of smart, digital technologies, to unlock opportunities for more control, choice and flexibility in how consumers use energy.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=23&annotation=D443A3MH)
> “Energy smart” appliances can take advantage of cheaper prices and operate flexibly, automatically operating when prices are lower, providing balancing services to the grid and generating revenue for consumers. We will support industry uptake of PAS 1878, a voluntary standard for “energy smart” appliances, to encourage development and deployment of DSRcapable devices. We will take powers, when parliamentary time allows, to regulate energy smart appliances, to set requirements underpinned by the principles of interoperability, data privacy, grid stability and cyber security.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=29&annotation=9X6SLG26)
> We will continue to work with industry to incorporate flexibility and smart technologies in the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) and, for non-domestic premises, Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM). These are assessment methodologies that are utilised in Building Regulations, Energy Performance Certificates and a range of energy efficiency and heat schemes. The government will also work with stakeholders and international partners to consider the merits of introducing a separate 'smart readiness indicator' for assessing how optimised a building is for smart technologies.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=29&annotation=GEQIY2F3)
> We recognise that smart technologies, including energy storage and flexible heating systems, will likely have an important role to play for new buildings and this will be investigated as part of the development work of the Future Homes and Future Buildings Standards.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=34&annotation=GKM7BASF)
> consumer protection measures and including smart technologies in heat and energy efficiency policies will help normalise smart technologies for consumers.

> The government and Ofgem will help consumers that would otherwise struggle to participate in smart energy, including through incorporating smart technologies in our fuel poverty strategy and policies, for example the Energy Company Obligation. We will use the findings of Project InvoLVe, which identified how innovation may help low income and vulnerable consumers to participate, to shape future innovation initiatives.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=35&annotation=X8FJRD7R)
> The government will incorporate flexibility and smart technologies into energy efficiency and heat policies, including regulations, assessment methodologies, subsidy schemes and market mechanisms.

> [!OrangeHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=74&annotation=44LKMYDG)
> This includes at least £100 million of innovation funding for energy storage and flexibility innovation programmes.

> Smart meters are installed in homes and small businesses, and consumers will have access to a wide range of interoperable and secure smart appliances, giving them the technical capability to participate in providing flexibility to the system.

> [!OrangeHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=75&annotation=3B3GTA24)
> The government will work with industry to support the uptake of PAS 1878 and 1879 for “energy smart” appliances, to encourage development and deployment of DSR-capable devices and to establish a technical framework for small-scale DSR.

> [!PurpleHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=76&annotation=SPWNQN9K)
> The government will aim to consult in 2022 on an appropriate regulatory approach for flexibility service providers and other organisations controlling load. We will ensure that regulatory approaches for smart appliances, chargepoints, home energy management systems, flexibility service providers and load control systems are aligned, and work closely with industry to deliver on our core principles of interoperability, data privacy, grid stability and cyber security.

> Issue: Digitalisation of the energy system brings new risks related to cyber security, which will increase and evolve as more smart devices are installed in homes and businesses and more organisations access them for flexibility and other services.  Outcome: Improved visibility of cyber security risks informing a system-wide approach, and cyber security protections are integrated into smart energy devices, organisations and systems, giving consumers the confidence to engage and protecting the energy system.

> [!OrangeHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=77&annotation=NYW6Z83V)
> We will embed a culture of cyber security across the smart energy system. For devices, we will deploy a 'Secure by Design' approach as a minimum baseline, so that future energy smart appliances and electric vehicle chargepoints are designed with appropriate cyber security protections from the start.  We will develop assurance approaches to support manufacturers and flexibility service providers in meeting the necessary standards.  The government will commission further work to set an enduring approach to monitoring and mitigating cyber security risks across a smart and flexible energy system.

> A robust consumer protection framework that gives consumers the confidence to participate, and those who might otherwise struggle to participate are supported to do so.

> [!OrangeHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9CTGWTSS?page=78&annotation=NX6UVPB3)
> Buildings will utilise smart and flexible technologies to optimise demand, support the electrification of heat, reduce consumer bills, reduce impacts on the electricity grid and support power sector decarbonisation.%% end annotations %%
