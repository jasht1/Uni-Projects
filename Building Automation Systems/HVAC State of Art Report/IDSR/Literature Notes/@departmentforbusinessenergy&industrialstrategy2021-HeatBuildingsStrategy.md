> Smart appliances, including heating appliances, are able to respond to price signals such as those from smart tariffs, or from national or local flexibility markets. Government is working with industry to develop standards for these appliances, to ensure interoperability and cyber security.

> Through the use of these technologies, energy consumers may also be able to provide contracted services to local or national networks – for example, shifting energy demand to help balance the system or alleviate a constraint. This will often be through an aggregator, who can bid into markets on consumers’ behalf using the flexibility from multiple buildings. We are working with Ofgem and the network companies to enable access to markets for smaller demand side assets.
