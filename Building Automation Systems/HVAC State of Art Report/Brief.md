## Summary

> [!Abstract]- Learning Objectives
> 1. Apply engineering methods and a systems approach to design building automation and HVAC control systems. 
> 2. Demonstrate an advanced knowledge of technological components used in HVAC control systems. 
> 3. Transfer and apply relevant industry standards to the building automation sector.

### Description

The building automation sector is rapidly developing to provide improved performance and meet more stringent requirements. You are required to submit a technical report that analyses and critically evaluates **two** advanced Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) technologies. 
**One technology must be used for the transfer of heat** (e.g. heating/cooling, refrigerants, pumps, etc.), **the other must be used for communication and/or control**. For each technology, your report should include: 
- how the technology complements the wider HVAC system and the problem it addresses 
- an analysis and critical evaluation 
- any health, safety or environmental considerations from legislation and/or industry standards. The technologies chosen must be active within the HVAC system. For example, passive solar or insulated building materials are outside the scope for this assessment.

### Weights

| **Weighting** | **Description**                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20%           | Demonstrate a comprehensive and critical understanding of HVAC systems                 |
| 50%           | Analyse and critically evaluate advanced HVAC technologies                             |
| 15%           | Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of relevant legislation and industry standards |
| 15%           | Quality of report and deliverables                                                     |

## Formatting

- A word-processed document in **Microsoft Word (.docx)** format. 
- Do not include the assessment brief or questions in your work.

- Your report should include a cover page with your report title, author name, student number, university logo and address, and date of submission. 
- You should also include an abstract, table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, and references.

- Your text body should be 12pt, justified, and 1.5 line spacing with normal margins of 2.54 cm around. You should use section breaks (next page) to separate your document appropriately. 
- The main body of the report (from the first heading to the end of the references) must not exceed **7 pages**.

- Headings should be numbered in a technical report style, for example, “3 Methodology” and “3.1 Experimental Setup”. 
- Figures and tables should be labelled and captioned and referred to within the text (preferably prior, but always close to where they appear in the report). All figures should be clear, high quality and suitably sized. If they include text, it should be easily readable when printed. Figures should also be clear if viewed in black and white. If a figure is not your own work, a citation should be provided accrediting the source.

- IEEE referencing style.
