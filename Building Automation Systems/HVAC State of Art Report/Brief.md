## Summary

> [!Abstract]- Learning Objectives
> 1. Apply engineering methods and a systems approach to design building  automation and HVAC control systems.  
> 2. Demonstrate an advanced knowledge of technological components used in  HVAC control systems.  
> 3. Transfer and apply relevant industry standards to the building automation  sector.

The building automation sector is rapidly developing to provide improved performance  and meet more stringent requirements. You are required to submit a technical report  that analyses and critically evaluates two advanced Heating, Ventilation & Air  Conditioning (HVAC) technologies. One technology must be used for the transfer of heat  (e.g. heating/cooling, refrigerants, pumps, etc.), the other must be used for  communication and/or control. For each technology, your report should include: 
- how the technology complements the wider HVAC system and the problem it  addresses 
- an analysis and critical evaluation 
- any health, safety or environmental considerations from legislation and/or  industry standards.  The technologies chosen must be active within the HVAC system. For example, passive  solar or insulated building materials are outside the scope for this assessment.
