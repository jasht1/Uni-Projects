> [!abstract]- Abstract
> With advances in solid-state cooling materials in the past decade, non-vapor compression technologies, or not-in-kind (NIK) cooling technologies have garnered great attention. Therefore, a universal performance index is urgently needed to compare these NIK technologies with each other and vapor compression cooling as well. In this study, a systematic method is developed to visualize the contributions to the coefficient of performance (COP) from materials (working fluids) level to the system level as a function of temperature lifts. Since the materials level COP depends solely on the materials properties under the specified cycle, it can be used for comparing refrigerants for all NIK technologies. We chose the water-cooled water chiller operating under identical conditions as the basis for the system performance comparison of all NIK cooling technologies. Upon normalizing the system COP to the Carnot COP, its variation with the system temperature lift reveals the intrinsic potential applications for each NIK cooling technology.

> Bansal et al.  (2011) reviewed the NIK technologies as well as the latest advances in traditional vapor  compression cooling technology from the viewpoint of energy efficiency improvement for  household appliances, and also stressed the potential of both the magnetocaloric cooling and the  thermoelectric cooling.

> The magnetocaloric cooling system is the only NIK technology superior to the baseline.

> It was found that from both the materials and the system perspective, magnetocaloric cooling is  so far the only NIK technology better than the vapor compression cooling.%% end annotations %%
