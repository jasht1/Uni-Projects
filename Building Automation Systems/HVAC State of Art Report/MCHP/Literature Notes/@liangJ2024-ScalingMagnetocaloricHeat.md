> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Building decarbonization necessitates renewable heating and cooling solutions such as heat pumps. Magnetocaloric heat pumps (MCHP) offer environmental and efficiency advantages but face challenges when scaling up from existing active magnetic regenerator configurations. This study highlights uneven flow resistance, porosity, and refrigerant magnetocaloric effects as key obstacles to MCHP performance in parallel multi-bed setups. To address these effects, two control strategies for the fluid flow control system were investigated: measurement feedback control and model predictive control. Results show a 36.9 % heating power improvement with measurement feedback control, though with extended control convergence times. Model predictive control achieved approximately seven times faster control convergence compared to the measurement feedback control strategy, despite exhibiting minor overshooting. Utilization factor-based model predictive control increased the heating capacity by 1.6 %–30.9 % and the COP by 1.2 %–10.7 % in scenarios with uneven flow resistance and porosity, offering computational efficiency but assuming even magnetocaloric effects between regenerators. This assumption can be addressed by outlet temperature-based model predictive control, albeit at a higher computational cost using genetic algorithm. The findings emphasize the importance of advanced control methods to scaling up MCHP in renewable energy building systems.

> "achieving the required heating capacity of at least 1 kW for the building system necessitates scaling up MCHP with multi-bed AMRs, which can be hydraulically connected in series or parallel. Serially connected devices, typically comprising two AMR beds sharing a common cold reservoir with flow provided by reciprocating displacers, offer advantages such as balanced flow in each bed and flow calculation based on displacer geometry [44–46]. Conversely, parallelly connected AMR beds feature a fluid circulator with constant unidirectional flow connected to a set of flow manifolds [47–49]. Here, individual AMR beds are hydraulically connected in parallel via flow manifolds, and flow to each bed is controlled by valves. The advantages of a parallel flow circuit include a more compact system and less expensive construction due to better magnetic field utilization. However, parallel connections between beds may result in unequal flow distribution, leading to unbalanced fluid flow and reduced AMR performance [50]."

> "There is a consensus in the literature that optimizing cooling capacity involves displacing fluid during periods of extreme magnetic field values with minimized transition times between high and low levels [51,52]. This allows for flexibility in synchronizing the flow rate profile with the magnetic field profile, ranging from center-aligned to end-aligned, or anywhere in between, yielding competitive performance [53]. Center alignment ensures sufficient temperature difference between solid and fluid at low blow fractions, while end alignment prevents fluid flow during magnetic field reversal, crucial at high blow fractions [54]."

> two primary configurations based on the movement of MCM within a magnetic field: (a) Reciprocating [36], where the AMR reciprocates in and out of the magnetic field using dual magnetic field sources for continuous cooling; (b) Rotary [37], wherein the AMR rotates and traverses a circular path in and out of the field, with fluid flow categorized as axial [38], radial [39], and azimuthal [40]. The rotation of the magnetic field source over static AMR is a prevalent technique in recent prototypes [30].> [!OrangeHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZL7UUXJE?page=15&annotation=EDNIMB7X)
