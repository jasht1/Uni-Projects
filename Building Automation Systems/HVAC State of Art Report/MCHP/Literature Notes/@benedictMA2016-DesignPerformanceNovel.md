> [!abstract]- Abstract
> The design and preliminary results of an active magnetic refrigeration prototype for room temperature cooling applications are investigated. The physical prototype along with its operational and measurement envelopes are described. General design goals included: A wide range of cycle parameter control, independent fluid and magnetic circuits, extensive measurement capability, and compact overall design. An initial set of measurements has been made with Gadolinium particulate of an industrial purity. The maximum no-load span recorded was 21 K and the maximum power recorded was 26 W at a span of 1 K. Additionally, three different cyclical parameters have been varied to help determine the optimal cycle for such a machine. The unique modularity and control of this system will allow for a detailed understanding of the operation of commercial active magnetic regeneration designs.
