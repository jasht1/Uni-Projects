> [!abstract]- Abstract
> The performance of a magnetocaloric heat pump (MCHP) consisting of active magnetocaloric regenerators (AMR) of 12 layers of MnFePSi magnetocaloric materials (MCM) with a linear distribution of Curie temperatures was investigated using a 1D numerical model. The model predicted the heating power and coefficient of performance (COP) of the AMR for a fixed temperature span of 27K, between 281K and 308K, and variable flow rate and AMR cycle frequency. A maximum applied magnetic field strength of 1.4T was used. A well-insulated house with a maximum heating power demand of 3kW (under quasi steady state conditions) was considered. Ambient temperature in The Netherlands was taken as a reference for the estimation of the seasonal heating power demand. Without optimizing the design of the AMR, the model predicts a maximum single-AMR heating power equal to 43.5W when the AMR operates at 3Hz and 3Lmin-1, and a maximum COP equal to 5.8 when it operates at 1.5Hz and 1Lmin-1 Considering the maximum heating power of a single AMR, approximately 69 AMRs are needed to provide the design heating power demand of the house. It was found that it is possible to achieve an AMR seasonal COP of 5.6 by continuously adjusting the flow rate and frequency of operation of the MCHP along with the ON/OFF switching of some groups of AMRs in order to adjust the heating power of the MCHP to the heating power demand of the house.

> Magnetocaloric heat pumps (MCHP) generally consist of three main elements: a porous structure of magnetocaloric material (MCM), a type of compound that exhibits a thermal response when subjected to a magnetic field change known as the magnetocaloric effect (MCE); a magnetic field source such as a permanent magnet to trigger the MCE; and a heat transfer fluid (HTF) that flows through the porous structure of MCM and through external heat exchangers transporting heat from the cold to the hot side of the heat pump in this process. The porous structure of MCM is known as active magnetocaloric regenerator (AMR) and has the double function of regenerator and solid refrigerant.

> The magnetocaloric refrigeration cycle consists of four steps: magnetization, iso-field cooling (also known as cold-to-hot blow of HTF), demagnetization, and iso-field heating (also known as hot-to-cold blow of HTF). Depending on the synchronization between the magnetic field change and the flow of HTF, the magnetization and demagnetization processes can be adiabatic, isothermal, or somewhere in between, producing a Brayton-like cycle, an Ericsson-like cycle, or a cycle in between Brayton and Ericsson respectively

> Magnetocaloric heat pumps and refrigerators operate under the same working principle and could be regarded as the same device just as vapour compression heat pumps and refrigerators.

> In general, in both technologies, refrigerators and heat pumps use different refrigerants because the selection of the refrigerant(s) depends on the working temperature range of the device.

> Using a GSHEX is advantageous for any type of heat pump given that the temperature of the ground is higher than ambient temperature in the coldest months of the heating season and fluctuates less throughout the year.

> UFH system can operate at lower temperatures in comparison with radiators while providing comfort to the occupants of the house, which is also beneficial for any type of heat pump given that smaller temperature spans are linked to higher efficiencies.

> Separating the MCHP from the external heat exchangers also minimizes the risk of contamination of the HTF that flows through the AMRs. Furthermore, the HTF that flows through the MCHP needs some special additives to avoid corrosion of the MCM and freezing, so minimizing its volume is convenient. One disadvantage of the system configuration with intermediate heat exchangers is that the entropy production increases, and thus the overall efficiency of the heat pump reduces.

> MCHPs in particular have the advantage that the COP is larger at part-load conditions even when they operate at a fixed temperature span

> Johra et al. (2018) proposed to control the capacity of an MCHP by operating at a constant cycle frequency of 1 Hz and a variable flow rate. They simulated a house of nine rooms, every one of which was equipped with an independent UFH circuit that was switched ON and OFF to maintain a desired temperature in the room. The total flow rate of the MCHP changed in discrete steps depending on the number of UFH circuits demanding warm water. When none of the UFH circuits was demanding warm water, the MCHP and the circulation pump were turned OFF. When considering a room temperature of 22 ◦C, an undisturbed ground temperature of 10 ◦C, and the Danish weather conditions for the months January to April 2013, they calculated an AMR SCOP of 3.93 and a corresponding system SCOP of 1.84. The difference between these two results originated from running a centrifugal pump far from its optimum operating region. To reduce the difference between AMR and system SCOP, the same research group proposed later an ON/OFF control strategy whereby the MCHP was operated most of the time at the flow rate that produced the maximum COP (for the same cycle frequency of 1 Hz) and the thermal mass of the house was used to store the excess energy supplied by the heat pump. The average temperature inside the house (calculated as the weighted average using the floor area of the rooms as weighting parameter) was allowed to fluctuate between an upper and a lower limit. When these limits were reached, the MCHP was switched OFF and ON respectively. When a particular room reached the upper temperature limit the corresponding UFH circuit was closed and the total flow rate of the MCHP decreased, moving the heat pump from its optimum performance point. When considering an upper/lower limit temperature difference of 4 K and a house thermal inertia of 60 W h K−1 m−2, they found that the system operated at least 70% of the time at the optimum flow rate and the system SCOP increased to 3.48 (Johra et al., 2019). The disadvantage of this strategy is that the temperature fluctuation could bring discomfort to occupants.
