> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Efficiency improvements in heat pump can drastically reduce global energy demand. Caloric heat pumps are currently being investigated as a potentially more efficient alternative to vapor compression systems. Caloric heat pumps are driven by solid-state materials that exhibit a significant change in temperature when a field is applied, such as a magnetic or an electric field as well as mechanical stress. For most caloric materials, the phase transition results in a certain amount of power dissipation, which drastically impacts the efficiency of a caloric cooling system. The impact on the efficiency can be expressed by a figure of merit (FOM), which can directly be deduced from material properties. This FOM has been derived for 36 different magneto-, elasto-, electro and barocaloric material classes based on literature data. It is found that the best materials can theoretically attain second law efficiencies of over 90%. The FOM is analogous to the isentropic efficiency of idealized compressors of vapor compression systems. The isentropic efficiency can thus be directly linked to the theoretically achievable efficiency of a compressor-based refrigeration system for a given refrigerant. In this work a theoretical comparison is made between efficiency of caloric heat pumps and vapor compression systems based on the material losses for the caloric heat pump and the efficiency of the compressor for vapor compression systems. The effect of heat regeneration is considered in both cases. In vapor compression systems, the effect of the working fluid on the efficiency is also studied.

> > Comparison of the achievable efficiencies of the different caloric technologies with classical compressors. FOM ranges of the best magnetocaloric materials (green), barocaloric materials (blue), electrocaloric (yellow) and elastocaloric materials (orange). The black curve shows the maximum achievable exergetic efficiency of a compressor system using isobutane (Th = 55 ◦C, Tc = 5 ◦C) as a function of the isentropic efficiency. The hatched area indicates the typical range of isentropic efficiency for today’s systems. Some experimental caloric systems of magnetocalorics (green), electrocalorics (yellow) and elastocalorics (orange) are marked as asterisks.

> In this comparison, loss types that are shared between the two technologies are ignored. The remaining efficiency reducers are hysteresis losses described by the FOM for caloric systems and losses during compression described by ηc for vapor compression systems.

> Magneto- and barocaloric materials are already at a point where systems are possible, that would even surpass a vapor compression system with a 100% efficient compressor. Nevertheless, up to now no system has been published where the efficiency exceeds 60% of Carnot. Thus, further effort in the development of caloric systems is required to get closer to the potential efficiency limit of caloric materials.> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ7BZKJJ?page=1&annotation=ESXIFS2G)
> Vapor compression systems, which are the most common type of heat pumps, achieve exergetic efficiencies of up to 50% [4, 5], indicating that there is still room for improvement.

> For a caloric system, the efficiency mainly gets diminished due to hysteresis of the phase transition.

> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AJ7BZKJJ?page=2&annotation=E65LV632)
> a small increase in hysteresis from 0.5% to 1% could reduce efficiency in active caloric regeneration systems by as much as 50%.

> Hess et al [15] provided a theoretical maximum performance of a caloric material in a Carnot-like cycle. Zeggai et al [16] later came to the same conclusion when looking at the efficiency of electrocaloric materials.

> The COP is defined as the ratio between heat that is being removed/added ∆Qc, ∆Qh by the system and the required work W that needs to be put into the system during one closed cycle:  COPcooling = ∆Qc  W , COPheating = ∆Qh  W .

> The idealized vapor compression cycle (figure 7(a)) can be divided into the following steps: 1 → 2 s /2: Starting from the evaporation curve, vapor gets compressed by the compressor. This causes vapor to reach a temperature above the condenser temperature. In an ideal and adiabatic compressor this step is isentropic and the vapor gets compressed to the point 2 s. Real compressors exhibit losses due to friction, causing the entropy to increase slightly during this step so that point 2 is reached at the end of this step 2 s/2 → 2′: The overheated gas gets cooled down isobarically by the condenser until it reaches the evaporation curve. 2′ → 3: After reaching the wet steam area the fluid gets liquified. This process is isothermal and isobaric. 3 → 4: The liquid working fluid gets expanded by throttling. This process step is in good approximation isenthalpically. 4 → 1: Heat intake to the liquid/vapor and evaporates it. Like 2′-3 this process is isobaric an isothermal as well. The irreversibility of a real compressor can be considered by the isentropic efficiency ηc of the compressor [88]. This is in accordance with international standards for performance measurements for refrigeration compressors, such as DIN EN 12 900 [89] or AHRI 540 [90], respectively. Assuming an adiabatic compressor for the considerations done here, the isentropic efficiency can be defined by:  ηc = h2s − h1  h2 − h1
