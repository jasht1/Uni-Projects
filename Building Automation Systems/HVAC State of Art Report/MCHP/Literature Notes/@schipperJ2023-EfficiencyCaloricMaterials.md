> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Efficiency improvements in heat pump can drastically reduce global energy demand. Caloric heat pumps are currently being investigated as a potentially more efficient alternative to vapor compression systems. Caloric heat pumps are driven by solid-state materials that exhibit a significant change in temperature when a field is applied, such as a magnetic or an electric field as well as mechanical stress. For most caloric materials, the phase transition results in a certain amount of power dissipation, which drastically impacts the efficiency of a caloric cooling system. The impact on the efficiency can be expressed by a figure of merit (FOM), which can directly be deduced from material properties. This FOM has been derived for 36 different magneto-, elasto-, electro and barocaloric material classes based on literature data. It is found that the best materials can theoretically attain second law efficiencies of over 90%. The FOM is analogous to the isentropic efficiency of idealized compressors of vapor compression systems. The isentropic efficiency can thus be directly linked to the theoretically achievable efficiency of a compressor-based refrigeration system for a given refrigerant. In this work a theoretical comparison is made between efficiency of caloric heat pumps and vapor compression systems based on the material losses for the caloric heat pump and the efficiency of the compressor for vapor compression systems. The effect of heat regeneration is considered in both cases. In vapor compression systems, the effect of the working fluid on the efficiency is also studied.

> The most common magnetocaloric materials are gadolinium and lanthanum-iron-silicon (LaFeSi) based alloys.

> The magnetocaloric materials in table 1 typically require fields of more than 10 T for a full phase transition. Current magnetocaloric demonstrators are based on permanent magnets which produce fields of around 1 T.

> > Comparison of the achievable efficiencies of the different caloric technologies with classical compressors. FOM ranges of the best magnetocaloric materials (green), barocaloric materials (blue), electrocaloric (yellow) and elastocaloric materials (orange). The black curve shows the maximum achievable exergetic efficiency of a compressor system using isobutane (Th = 55 ◦C, Tc = 5 ◦C) as a function of the isentropic efficiency. The hatched area indicates the typical range of isentropic efficiency for today’s systems. Some experimental caloric systems of magnetocalorics (green), electrocalorics (yellow) and elastocalorics (orange) are marked as asterisks.

> In this comparison, loss types that are shared between the two technologies are ignored. The remaining efficiency reducers are hysteresis losses described by the FOM for caloric systems and losses during compression described by ηc for vapor compression systems.

> Magneto- and barocaloric materials are already at a point where systems are possible, that would even surpass a vapor compression system with a 100% efficient compressor. Nevertheless, up to now no system has been published where the efficiency exceeds 60% of Carnot. Thus, further effort in the development of caloric systems is required to get closer to the potential efficiency limit of caloric materials.%% end annotations %%
