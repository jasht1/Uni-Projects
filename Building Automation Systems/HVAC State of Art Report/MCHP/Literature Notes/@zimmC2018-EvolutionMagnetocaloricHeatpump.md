> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Magnetocaloric heat pumps (MHPs) use the solid-state magnetocaloric effect (MCE) to move heat from cold to hot using an intermediate heat-transfer fluid. Work input is required to drive the MCE via a change in a magnetic field. Work input is also required to drive the heat-transfer fluid flow. Thus design of a MHP involves the coupling of materials, magnetics, heat transfer, and fluid flow. We discuss design principles and operational devices that have brought this technology toward technical feasibility, and the approaches to overcome remaining hurdles to commercial feasibility.

> A major advantage of the AMR cycle is that the span (heat-rejection temperature minus heat-absorption temperature) can be much larger than the magnetocaloric ΔT.

> When cost effectiveness of a magnetic refrigerator is the primary goal, a good figure of merit is the specific cooling power, the cooling power per unit volume of MCMs. This is because the MCM must fit within the magnet gap, the size and cost of a magnet when optimally designed9 is proportional to its gap volume, and the permanent magnet dominates the cost of an MHP.> [!YellowHighlight] [see in Zotero](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/93MKUWGL?page=275&annotation=H85WHV39)
> Because the fluid is successively cooled by MCM in the demagnetized bed and successively warmed by MCM in the magnetized bed, a regenerative effect occurs that allows the AMR span to be much larger than the magnetocaloric ΔT.
