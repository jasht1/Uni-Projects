> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Active magnetic regeneration is one of the most promising alternative technologies for the development of heat pumps and cooling systems for applications around room temperature. In the open literature, numerous works can be found in which much effort has been put on the development of magnetocaloric materials, magnetic circuits and prototypes. In this article, the authors discuss some of the main challenges encountered in the literature and how design choices impact cooling power and work requirements from a system engineering perspective. First, based on a generic schematic representation of a magnetocaloric heat pump, or refrigerator, various problems and challenges found in the current state of the art are pointed out and discussed. Second, different design principles for magnetic heat pumps are examined. As a means to improving performance, an extended design/optimization methodology is proposed based on entropy generation minimization with performance criteria. Finally, some initial optimization results are presented and discussed.

> The main components are: a regenerator assembly composed of MCM processed in a geometry with high surface area per unit volume, such as spherical particles in a packed bed; a magnetic circuit; a motion mechanism to modulate the magnetic field seen by the regenerator; a pumping system to create oscillating flow through the regenerator which transfers heat between the regenerator and the thermal reservoirs; and, the heat exchangers (Rowe 2011).

> Magnetic cooling systems using an AMR cycle employ the MCM as a solid state refrigerant and as a regenerator.

> Initial magnetic heat pump prototypes developed by Brown (1976) and Zimm et al. (1998) used superconducting coils to generate the magnetic field. In contrast, current state-of-art prototypes use permanent magnet circuits.

> Permanent magnets are advantageous mainly because of the relatively small energy cost to generate magnetic fields of the order of 1 up to 2 T. Other advantageous characteristics of permanent magnets are: (1) little maintenance is required; (2) the confined magnetic flux lines thereby avoiding electromagnetic perturbations in the surroundings; and, (3) they can be recycled.
