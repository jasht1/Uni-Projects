> [!abstract]- Abstract
> Cooling with caloric materials could be an option to replace compressor-based cooling systems in the future. In addition to the advantage of avoiding dangerous liquid coolants, one often cites a possible higher efficiency of the calorific cooling systems compared to compressor-based systems. But is that true? The aim of this work is to assess the efficiency potential of caloric cooling systems on a very basic material level. We placed our focus on materials with a first-order phase change since they generally show a large caloric response. We derive a relation between thermal hysteresis and the dissipative losses due to hysteresis. To predict the efficiency, this relation is integrated in a Carnot-like cycle. This approach was chosen to get access to the efficiency reduction due to hysteresis without any further losses due to other nonidealities of the thermodynamic cycle. As a main finding, we present a direct relation between thermal hysteresis and the expected maximum exergy or second-law efficiency of a caloric cooling device. These results indicate that, for many caloric materials, the thermal hysteresis needs to be further reduced to be able to compete with the efficiency of compressor-based systems.

> Hysteresis of caloric materials generally appears in two different ways. First the hysteresis of the corresponding order parameter (magnetization, polarization, deformation) versus the corresponding field parameter (magnetic, electric, pressure), which is defined as »isothermal field hysteresis«. The closed curve integral of the isothermal field hysteresis loop for a phase change corresponds to the dissipative heat produced when undergoing this phase change.

> A second form of hysteresis the transition temperature varies depending on the direction of the phase change (from the low temperature phase to the high temperature phase or from high to low). This effect can be measured by a shift of the heat capacitance peak for a heating and cooling measurement protocol [9,10]. This is defined as »thermal hysteresis«.

> A detailed review on different figures of merit for caloric materials is given by Griffith et al. [11]. Moya et al. [12] for example introduced a material parameter, which can be used to sort the caloric materials with respect to their expected performance but cannot be used to predict the system performance. Qian et al. [13] proposed the material specific value COPmat to predict the potential thermodynamic efficiency of different caloric materials.

> Since most caloric materials show an adiabatic temperature change of only a few Kelvin, a cascaded system needs to be taken into account in order to attain relevant temperature lifts.
