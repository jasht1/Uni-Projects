There are many competing designs of MCHP being actively developed, but in general they consist of some arrangement of: a high surface area to volume structure of [[magnetocaloric material (MCM)]] usually referred to as an active magnetocaloric regenerator (AMR), a magnetic field source, heat transfer fluid, a pump, and a heat exchanger. [@trevizoliPV2016-MagneticHeatPumps] 
Typically the heat exchanger, pump and heat transfer fluid are no different to a traditional heat pump, a water/glycol mix is pumped to and from the AMR to heat exchanger(s) to move energy from a cold to a hot reservoir. [@trevizoliPV2016-MagneticHeatPumps] 

MCHPs tend to use several AMR beds, not least because the
