- Gas boiler
	- gas explodes, poisons, pollutes, and drives global warming
	- less than they used to but still not great
- Heat pumps
	- Refrigerants
		- drive global warming, some destroy ozone layer
		- high pressure
	- CO2
		- Even higher pressure
- MCHP
	- Handling powerful permanent magnets can be dangerous
	- Large spinning mass
	- Gadolinium is used in MRI contrast enhancer injections. In any case there will typically be heat exchangers between the thermal transfer fluids directly exposed to the AFM. [@thematerialspreparationcenteratameslaboratory2016-GadoliniumSafteyData]

## Legislation

The UKs future homes standard would require new homes and non-domestic buildings to be ‘zero-carbon ready’ with gas boilers no longer being an option for developers. [@-FutureHomesBuildingsStandards] The UK is also one of the many countries under the Montreal Protocol that have taken action to phase out HFC's and other F gasses commonly used as refrigerants in VCHPs. VCHP manufacturers are proposing alternatives such as propane, R454C, and CO2, but all of these come with safety concerns: propane & R454C are highly flammable and CO2 requires significantly higher operating pressures. The industry as is searching for green, safe solutions. [@-OutlookDaikinRefrigerant]
