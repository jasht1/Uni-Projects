The magnetochaloric effect refers to the temperature change of a magnetic material associated with the application of a magnetic field. This is due to the contribution of the changing arrangement of the magnetic sub-lattice to entropy. [@casanovaifernandezF2004-MagnetocaloricEffectGd5SixGe1x4] 
This effect can be used in place of compression in traditional vapour compression based heat pumps as follows: In place of isothermal compression, isothermal magnetisation induces an alignment of the magnetic sub-lattice decreasing entropy which can be converted to heat. In place of adiabatic expansion, adiabatic demagnetisation where heat is converted into magnetic entropy i.e. disorder in the magnetic sub-lattice.[@casanovaifernandezF2004-MagnetocaloricEffectGd5SixGe1x4]
