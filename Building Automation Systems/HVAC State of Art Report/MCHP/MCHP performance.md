MCHP domestic & commercial heating solutions are a nascent technology but it is a promising alternative to vapour compression (VC) with several studies indicating potential for higher COP and higher temperature lift / span than existing VC based heat pump technologies. [@qianS2016-Not-in-kindCoolingTechnologies; @johraH2024-PerformanceOverviewCaloricHeatPumps; @schipperJ2023-EfficiencyCaloricMaterials] Figure of merit (FOM) is a metric used to compare caloric technologies as it is analogous to the isentropic efficiency of the compressor in traditional heat pumps or refrigerators. [@schipperJ2023-EfficiencyCaloricMaterials] 

Setting aside the parasitic losses all heat pumps share i.e. motors, pumps, heat exchangers, radiative losses etc.

The key loss to consider in a vapour compression heat pump (VCHP) is superheating during compression due to friction in the refrigerant itself.

In contrast MCHPs do work via the [Magnetochaloric effect (MCP)](Magnetochaloric%20effect%20(MCP).md) with loss due to hysteresis of the [magnetocaloric material (MCM)](magnetocaloric%20material%20(MCM).md) 

$$\eta_{c}= h_{2s} $$



FOM is a measure of __ from which COP can then be derived by accounting for the remaining parasitic losses

Studies have further indicated that there are still significant improvements in power and temperature span to be unlocked with optimisations in design and control based on the exergetic efficiency of [magnetocaloric material (MCM)](magnetocaloric%20material%20(MCM).md) compared with traditional refrigerants.
