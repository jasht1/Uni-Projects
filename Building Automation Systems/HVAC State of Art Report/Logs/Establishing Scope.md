Electrification of heating (and cooling) is likely vital, for many this means heat pumps however the issue of refrigerants cannot be ignored. Current generation refrigerants used in heat pumps pose huge environmental impacts especially as we have proven to be constantly unable to effectively deal with them at product EOL. 

I would be interested in investigating a non refrigerant based electric heating alternative.

The UK grid, like many large scale grids, is struggling to take advantage of surplus generation of distributed renewables effectively. Many commercial & industrial sites have the potential to contribute to the energy transition through installing their own renewable generation capacity to supply their own onsite demand and export excess generation to the national grid. However the grid must be able to regulate how and when to allow this power onto the grid. I would like to investigate the technologies that make this possible.
